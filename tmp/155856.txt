During the winter of 1927‚Äì28 officials of the Federal government mad
e a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the anci
ent Massachusetts seaport of Innsmouth. The public first learned of it
 in February, when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred, follow
ed by the deliberate burning and dynamiting‚Äîunder suitable precautio
ns‚Äîof an enormous number of crumbling, worm-eaten, and supposedly em
pty houses along the abandoned waterfront. Uninquiring souls let this 
occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liqu
or. Keener news-followers, however, wondered at the prodigious number 
of arrests, the abnormally large force of men used in making them, and
 the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners. No trials, or 
even definite charges, were reported; nor were any of the captives see
n thereafter in the regular gaols of the nation. There were vague stat
ements about disease and concentration camps, and later about dispersa
l in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive ever dev
eloped. Innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated, and is even now 
only beginning to shew signs of a sluggishly revived existence. Compla
ints from many liberal organisations were met with long confidential d
iscussions, and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps a
nd prisons. As a result, these societies became surprisingly passive a
nd reticent. Newspaper men were harder to manage, but seemed largely t
o co√∂perate with the government in the end. Only one paper‚Äîa tabloi
d always discounted because of its wild policy‚Äîmentioned the deep-di
ving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss 
just beyond Devil Reef. That item, gathered by chance in a haunt of sa
ilors, seemed indeed rather far-fetched; since the low, black reef lie
s a full mile and a half out from Innsmouth Harbour. People around the
 country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselve
s, but said very little to the outer world. They had talked about dyin
g and half-deserted Innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new co
uld be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted 
years before. Many things had taught them secretiveness, and there was
 now no need to exert pressure on them. Besides, they really knew very
 little; for wide salt marshes, desolate and unpeopled, keep neighbour
s off from Innsmouth on the landward side. But at last I am going to d
efy the ban on speech about this thing. Results, I am certain, are so 
thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accr
ue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at Inns
mouth. Besides, what was found might possibly have more than one expla
nation. I do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told ev
en to me, and I have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper. For
 my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other la
yman, and I have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to
 drastic measures. It was I who fled frantically out of Innsmouth in t
he early morning hours of July 16, 1927, and whose frightened appeals 
for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episod
e. I was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and un
certain; but now that it is an old story, with public interest and cur
iosity gone, I have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightfu
l hours in that ill-rumoured and evilly shadowed seaport of death and 
blasphemous abnormality. The mere telling helps me to restore confiden
ce in my own faculties; to reassure myself that I was not simply the f
irst to succumb to a contagious nightmare hallucination. It helps me, 
too, in making up my mind regarding a certain terrible step which lies
 ahead of me. I never heard of Innsmouth till the day before I saw it 
for the first and‚Äîso far‚Äîlast time. I was celebrating my coming of
 age by a tour of New England‚Äîsightseeing, antiquarian, and genealog
ical‚Äîand had planned to go directly from ancient Newburyport to Arkh
am, whence my mother‚Äôs family was derived. I had no car, but was tra
velling by train, trolley, and motor-coach, always seeking the cheapes
t possible route. In Newburyport they told me that the steam train was
 the thing to take to Arkham; and it was only at the station ticket-of
fice, when I demurred at the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth
. The stout, shrewd-faced agent, whose speech shewed him to be no loca
l man, seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy, and made a sug
gestion that none of my other informants had offered. ‚ÄúYou could tak
e that old bus, I suppose,‚Äù he said with a certain hesitation, ‚Äúbu
t it ain‚Äôt thought much of hereabouts. It goes through Innsmouth‚Äîy
ou may have heard about that‚Äîand so the people don‚Äôt like it. Run 
by an Innsmouth fellow‚ÄîJoe Sargent‚Äîbut never gets any custom from 
here, or Arkham either, I guess. Wonder it keeps running at all. I s‚Ä
ôpose it‚Äôs cheap enough, but I never see more‚Äôn two or three peopl
e in it‚Äînobody but those Innsmouth folks. Leaves the Square‚Äîfront 
of Hammond‚Äôs Drug Store‚Äîat 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. unless they‚Äôve cha
nged lately. Looks like a terrible rattletrap‚ÄîI‚Äôve never ben on it
.‚Äù That was the first I ever heard of shadowed Innsmouth. Any refere
nce to a town not shewn on common maps or listed in recent guide-books
 would have interested me, and the agent‚Äôs odd manner of allusion ro
used something like real curiosity. A town able to inspire such dislik
e in its neighbours, I thought, must be at least rather unusual, and w
orthy of a tourist‚Äôs attention. If it came before Arkham I would sto
p off there‚Äîand so I asked the agent to tell me something about it. 
He was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly supe
rior to what he said. ‚ÄúInnsmouth? Well, it‚Äôs a queer kind of a tow
n down at the mouth of the Manuxet. Used to be almost a city‚Äîquite a
 port before the War of 1812‚Äîbut all gone to pieces in the last hund
red years or so. No railroad now‚ÄîB. & M. never went through, and the
 branch line from Rowley was given up years ago. ‚ÄúMore empty houses 
than there are people, I guess, and no business to speak of except fis
hing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly here or in Arkham or Ipsw
ich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing‚Äôs left now except 
one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time. ‚ÄúThat re
finery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns it
, must be richer‚Äôn Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks might
y close in his home. He‚Äôs supposed to have developed some skin disea
se or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandso
n of Captain Obed Marsh, who founded the business. His mother seems to
‚Äôve ben some kind of foreigner‚Äîthey say a South Sea islander‚Äîso 
everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich girl fifty years ago.
 They always do that about Innsmouth people, and folks here and hereab
outs always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in ‚Äôem. Bu
t Marsh‚Äôs children and grandchildren look just like anyone else so f
ar‚Äôs I can see. I‚Äôve had ‚Äôem pointed out to me here‚Äîthough, co
me to think of it, the elder children don‚Äôt seem to be around lately
. Never saw the old man. ‚ÄúAnd why is everybody so down on Innsmouth?
 Well, young fellow, you mustn‚Äôt take too much stock in what people 
around here say. They‚Äôre hard to get started, but once they do get s
tarted they never let up. They‚Äôve ben telling things about Innsmouth
‚Äîwhispering ‚Äôem, mostly‚Äîfor the last hundred years, I guess, and
 I gather they‚Äôre more scared than anything else. Some of the storie
s would make you laugh‚Äîabout old Captain Marsh driving bargains with
 the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or abou
t some kind of devil-worship and awful sacrifices in some place near t
he wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereabouts‚Äîbut I 
come from Panton, Vermont, and that kind of story don‚Äôt go down with
 me. ‚ÄúYou ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell ab
out the black reef off the coast‚ÄîDevil Reef, they call it. It‚Äôs we
ll above water a good part of the time, and never much below it, but a
t that you could hardly call it an island. The story is that there‚Äôs
 a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reef‚Äîsprawled about
, or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top. It‚Äôs a r
ugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end of
 shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it. ‚ÄúT
hat is, sailors that didn‚Äôt hail from Innsmouth. One of the things t
hey had against old Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on 
it sometimes at night when the tide was right. Maybe he did, for I dar
e say the rock formation was interesting, and it‚Äôs just barely possi
ble he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it; but there was
 talk of his dealing with daemons there. Fact is, I guess on the whole
 it was really the Captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef. ‚
ÄúThat was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks i
n Innsmouth was carried off. They never did quite figure out what the 
trouble was, but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought 
from China or somewhere by the shipping. It surely was bad enough‚Äîth
ere was riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that I don‚Äôt 
believe ever got outside of town‚Äîand it left the place in awful shap
e. Never came back‚Äîthere can‚Äôt be more‚Äôn 300 or 400 people livin
g there now. ‚ÄúBut the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply
 race prejudice‚Äîand I don‚Äôt say I‚Äôm blaming those that hold it. 
I hate those Innsmouth folks myself, and I wouldn‚Äôt care to go to th
eir town. I s‚Äôpose you know‚Äîthough I can see you‚Äôre a Westerner 
by your talk‚Äîwhat a lot our New England ships used to have to do wit
h queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, an
d what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with ‚Äôem. Y
ou‚Äôve probably heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chine
se wife, and maybe you know there‚Äôs still a bunch of Fiji Islanders 
somewhere around Cape Cod. ‚ÄúWell, there must be something like that 
back of the Innsmouth people. The place always was badly cut off from 
the rest of the country by marshes and creeks, and we can‚Äôt be sure 
about the ins and outs of the matter; but it‚Äôs pretty clear that old
 Captain Marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had a
ll three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties.
 There certainly is a strange kind of streak in the Innsmouth folks to
day‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it sort of makes you crawl
. You‚Äôll notice a little in Sargent if you take his bus. Some of ‚Äô
em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy, stary eyes that 
never seem to shut, and their skin ain‚Äôt quite right. Rough and scab
by, and the sides of their necks are all shrivelled or creased up. Get
 bald, too, very young. The older fellows look the worst‚Äîfact is, I 
don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever seen a very old chap of that kind. Guess t
hey must die of looking in the glass! Animals hate ‚Äôem‚Äîthey used t
o have lots of horse trouble before autos came in. ‚ÄúNobody around he
re or in Arkham or Ipswich will have anything to do with ‚Äôem, and th
ey act kind of offish themselves when they come to town or when anyone
 tries to fish on their grounds. Queer how fish are always thick off I
nnsmouth Harbour when there ain‚Äôt any anywhere else around‚Äîbut jus
t try to fish there yourself and see how the folks chase you off! Thos
e people used to come here on the railroad‚Äîwalking and taking the tr
ain at Rowley after the branch was dropped‚Äîbut now they use that bus
. ‚ÄúYes, there‚Äôs a hotel in Innsmouth‚Äîcalled the Gilman House‚Äîb
ut I don‚Äôt believe it can amount to much. I wouldn‚Äôt advise you to
 try it. Better stay over here and take the ten o‚Äôclock bus tomorrow
 morning; then you can get an evening bus there for Arkham at eight o‚
Äôclock. There was a factory inspector who stopped at the Gilman a cou
ple of years ago, and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the place
. Seems they get a queer crowd there, for this fellow heard voices in 
other rooms‚Äîthough most of ‚Äôem was empty‚Äîthat gave him the shive
rs. It was foreign talk, he thought, but he said the bad thing about i
t was the kind of voice that sometimes spoke. It sounded so unnatural‚
Äîslopping-like, he said‚Äîthat he didn‚Äôt dare undress and go to sle
ep. Just waited up and lit out the first thing in the morning. The tal
k went on most all night. ‚ÄúThis fellow‚ÄîCasey, his name was‚Äîhad a
 lot to say about how the Innsmouth folks watched him and seemed kind 
of on guard. He found the Marsh refinery a queer place‚Äîit‚Äôs in an 
old mill on the lower falls of the Manuxet. What he said tallied up wi
th what I‚Äôd heard. Books in bad shape, and no clear account of any k
ind of dealings. You know it‚Äôs always ben a kind of mystery where th
e Marshes get the gold they refine. They‚Äôve never seemed to do much 
buying in that line, but years ago they shipped out an enormous lot of
 ingots. ‚ÄúUsed to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewellery that 
the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly, or that was se
en once or twice on some of the Marsh womenfolks. People allowed maybe
 old Captain Obed traded for it in some heathen port, especially since
 he was always ordering stacks of glass beads and trinkets such as sea
faring men used to get for native trade. Others thought and still thin
k he‚Äôd found an old pirate cache out on Devil Reef. But here‚Äôs a f
unny thing. The old Captain‚Äôs ben dead these sixty years, and there 
ain‚Äôt ben a good-sized ship out of the place since the Civil War; bu
t just the same the Marshes still keep on buying a few of those native
 trade things‚Äîmostly glass and rubber gewgaws, they tell me. Maybe t
he Innsmouth folks like ‚Äôem to look at themselves‚ÄîGawd knows they‚
Äôve gotten to be about as bad as South Sea cannibals and Guinea savag
es. ‚ÄúThat plague of ‚Äô46 must have taken off the best blood in the 
place. Anyway, they‚Äôre a doubtful lot now, and the Marshes and the o
ther rich folks are as bad as any. As I told you, there probably ain‚Ä
ôt more‚Äôn 400 people in the whole town in spite of all the streets t
hey say there are. I guess they‚Äôre what they call ‚Äòwhite trash‚Äô 
down South‚Äîlawless and sly, and full of secret doings. They get a lo
t of fish and lobsters and do exporting by truck. Queer how the fish s
warm right there and nowhere else. ‚ÄúNobody can ever keep track of th
ese people, and state school officials and census men have a devil of 
a time. You can bet that prying strangers ain‚Äôt welcome around Innsm
outh. I‚Äôve heard personally of more‚Äôn one business or government m
an that‚Äôs disappeared there, and there‚Äôs loose talk of one who wen
t crazy and is out at Danvers now. They must have fixed up some awful 
scare for that fellow. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt go at night if I w
as you. I‚Äôve never ben there and have no wish to go, but I guess a d
aytime trip couldn‚Äôt hurt you‚Äîeven though the people hereabouts wi
ll advise you not to make it. If you‚Äôre just sightseeing, and lookin
g for old-time stuff, Innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you.‚Äù 
And so I spent part of that evening at the Newburyport Public Library 
looking up data about Innsmouth. When I had tried to question the nati
ves in the shops, the lunch room, the garages, and the fire station, I
 had found them even harder to get started than the ticket-agent had p
redicted; and realised that I could not spare the time to overcome the
ir first instinctive reticences. They had a kind of obscure suspicious
ness, as if there were something amiss with anyone too much interested
 in Innsmouth. At the Y.M.C.A., where I was stopping, the clerk merely
 discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and the people
 at the library shewed much the same attitude. Clearly, in the eyes of
 the educated, Innsmouth was merely an exaggerated case of civic degen
eration. The Essex County histories on the library shelves had very li
ttle to say, except that the town was founded in 1643, noted for shipb
uilding before the Revolution, a seat of great marine prosperity in th
e early nineteenth century, and later a minor factory centre using the
 Manuxet as power. The epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely t
reated, as if they formed a discredit to the county. References to dec
line were few, though the significance of the later record was unmista
kable. After the Civil War all industrial life was confined to the Mar
sh Refining Company, and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only 
remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing. That f
ishing paid less and less as the price of the commodity fell and large
-scale corporations offered competition, but there was never a dearth 
of fish around Innsmouth Harbour. Foreigners seldom settled there, and
 there was some discreetly veiled evidence that a number of Poles and 
Portuguese who had tried it had been scattered in a peculiarly drastic
 fashion. Most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the stra
nge jewellery vaguely associated with Innsmouth. It had evidently impr
essed the whole countryside more than a little, for mention was made o
f specimens in the museum of Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in t
he display room of the Newburyport Historical Society. The fragmentary
 descriptions of these things were bald and prosaic, but they hinted t
o me an undercurrent of persistent strangeness. Something about them s
eemed so odd and provocative that I could not put them out of my mind,
 and despite the relative lateness of the hour I resolved to see the l
ocal sample‚Äîsaid to be a large, queerly proportioned thing evidently
 meant for a tiara‚Äîif it could possibly be arranged. The librarian g
ave me a note of introduction to the curator of the Society, a Miss An
na Tilton, who lived nearby, and after a brief explanation that ancien
t gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building, si
nce the hour was not outrageously late. The collection was a notable o
ne indeed, but in my present mood I had eyes for nothing but the bizar
re object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric ligh
ts. It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally 
gasp at the strange, unearthly splendour of the alien, opulent phantas
y that rested there on a purple velvet cushion. Even now I can hardly 
describe what I saw, though it was clearly enough a sort of tiara, as 
the description had said. It was tall in front, and with a very large 
and curiously irregular periphery, as if designed for a head of almost
 freakishly elliptical outline. The material seemed to be predominantl
y gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange all
oy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal. Its cond
ition was almost perfect, and one could have spent hours in studying t
he striking and puzzlingly untraditional designs‚Äîsome simply geometr
ical, and some plainly marine‚Äîchased or moulded in high relief on it
s surface with a craftsmanship of incredible skill and grace. The long
er I looked, the more the thing fascinated me; and in this fascination
 there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or a
ccounted for. At first I decided that it was the queer other-worldly q
uality of the art which made me uneasy. All other art objects I had ev
er seen either belonged to some known racial or national stream, or el
se were consciously modernistic defiances of every recognised stream. 
This tiara was neither. It clearly belonged to some settled technique 
of infinite maturity and perfection, yet that technique was utterly re
mote from any‚ÄîEastern or Western, ancient or modern‚Äîwhich I had ev
er heard of or seen exemplified. It was as if the workmanship were tha
t of another planet. However, I soon saw that my uneasiness had a seco
nd and perhaps equally potent source residing in the pictorial and mat
hematical suggestions of the strange designs. The patterns all hinted 
of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the 
monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister. Amo
ng these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and
 malignity‚Äîhalf ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestion‚Äîwhich o
ne could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sens
e of pseudo-memory, as if they called up some image from deep cells an
d tissues whose retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely an
cestral. At times I fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fi
sh-frogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and
 inhuman evil. In odd contrast to the tiara‚Äôs aspect was its brief a
nd prosy history as related by Miss Tilton. It had been pawned for a r
idiculous sum at a shop in State Street in 1873, by a drunken Innsmout
h man shortly afterward killed in a brawl. The Society had acquired it
 directly from the pawnbroker, at once giving it a display worthy of i
ts quality. It was labelled as of probable East-Indian or Indo-Chinese
 provenance, though the attribution was frankly tentative. Miss Tilton
, comparing all possible hypotheses regarding its origin and its prese
nce in New England, was inclined to believe that it formed part of som
e exotic pirate hoard discovered by old Captain Obed Marsh. This view 
was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high 
price which the Marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its pres
ence, and which they repeated to this day despite the Society‚Äôs unva
rying determination not to sell. As the good lady shewed me out of the
 building she made it clear that the pirate theory of the Marsh fortun
e was a popular one among the intelligent people of the region. Her ow
n attitude toward shadowed Innsmouth‚Äîwhich she had never seen‚Äîwas 
one of disgust at a community slipping far down the cultural scale, an
d she assured me that the rumours of devil-worship were partly justifi
ed by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed
 all the orthodox churches. It was called, she said, ‚ÄúThe Esoteric O
rder of Dagon‚Äù, and was undoubtedly a debased, quasi-pagan thing imp
orted from the East a century before, at a time when the Innsmouth fis
heries seemed to be going barren. Its persistence among a simple peopl
e was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abun
dantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence on 
the town, replacing Freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters 
in the old Masonic Hall on New Church Green. All this, to the pious Mi
ss Tilton, formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of
 decay and desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive. To m
y architectural and historical anticipations was now added an acute an
thropological zeal, and I could scarcely sleep in my small room at the
 ‚ÄúY‚Äù as the night wore away. II. Shortly before ten the next morni
ng I stood with one small valise in front of Hammond‚Äôs Drug Store in
 old Market Square waiting for the Innsmouth bus. As the hour for its 
arrival drew near I noticed a general drift of the loungers to other p
laces up the street, or to the Ideal Lunch across the square. Evidentl
y the ticket-agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local people 
bore toward Innsmouth and its denizens. In a few moments a small motor
-coach of extreme decrepitude and dirty grey colour rattled down State
 Street, made a turn, and drew up at the curb beside me. I felt immedi
ately that it was the right one; a guess which the half-illegible sign
 on the windshield‚Äî‚ÄúArkham-Innsmouth-Newb‚Äôport‚Äù‚Äîsoon verifie
d. There were only three passengers‚Äîdark, unkempt men of sullen visa
ge and somewhat youthful cast‚Äîand when the vehicle stopped they clum
sily shambled out and began walking up State Street in a silent, almos
t furtive fashion. The driver also alighted, and I watched him as he w
ent into the drug store to make some purchase. This, I reflected, must
 be the Joe Sargent mentioned by the ticket-agent; and even before I n
oticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion
 which could be neither checked nor explained. It suddenly struck me a
s very natural that the local people should not wish to ride on a bus 
owned and driven by this man, or to visit any oftener than possible th
e habitat of such a man and his kinsfolk. When the driver came out of 
the store I looked at him more carefully and tried to determine the so
urce of my evil impression. He was a thin, stoop-shouldered man not mu
ch under six feet tall, dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and we
aring a frayed grey golf cap. His age was perhaps thirty-five, but the
 odd, deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when o
ne did not study his dull, expressionless face. He had a narrow head, 
bulging, watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a re
ceding forehead and chin, and singularly undeveloped ears. His long, t
hick lip and coarse-pored, greyish cheeks seemed almost beardless exce
pt for some sparse yellow hairs that straggled and curled in irregular
 patches; and in places the surface seemed queerly irregular, as if pe
eling from some cutaneous disease. His hands were large and heavily ve
ined, and had a very unusual greyish-blue tinge. The fingers were stri
kingly short in proportion to the rest of the structure, and seemed to
 have a tendency to curl closely into the huge palm. As he walked towa
rd the bus I observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his f
eet were inordinately immense. The more I studied them the more I wond
ered how he could buy any shoes to fit them. A certain greasiness abou
t the fellow increased my dislike. He was evidently given to working o
r lounging around the fish docks, and carried with him much of their c
haracteristic smell. Just what foreign blood was in him I could not ev
en guess. His oddities certainly did not look Asiatic, Polynesian, Lev
antine, or negroid, yet I could see why the people found him alien. I 
myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alien
age. I was sorry when I saw that there would be no other passengers on
 the bus. Somehow I did not like the idea of riding alone with this dr
iver. But as leaving time obviously approached I conquered my qualms a
nd followed the man aboard, extending him a dollar bill and murmuring 
the single word ‚ÄúInnsmouth‚Äù. He looked curiously at me for a secon
d as he returned forty cents change without speaking. I took a seat fa
r behind him, but on the same side of the bus, since I wished to watch
 the shore during the journey. At length the decrepit vehicle started 
with a jerk, and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of State
 Street amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust. Glancing at the peo
ple on the sidewalks, I thought I detected in them a curious wish to a
void looking at the bus‚Äîor at least a wish to avoid seeming to look 
at it. Then we turned to the left into High Street, where the going wa
s smoother; flying by stately old mansions of the early republic and s
till older colonial farmhouses, passing the Lower Green and Parker Riv
er, and finally emerging into a long, monotonous stretch of open shore
 country. The day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand, sedge
-grass, and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proc
eeded. Out the window I could see the blue water and the sandy line of
 Plum Island, and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow 
road veered off from the main highway to Rowley and Ipswich. There wer
e no visible houses, and I could tell by the state of the road that tr
affic was very light hereabouts. The small, weather-worn telephone pol
es carried only two wires. Now and then we crossed crude wooden bridge
s over tidal creeks that wound far inland and promoted the general iso
lation of the region. Once in a while I noticed dead stumps and crumbl
ing foundation-walls above the drifting sand, and recalled the old tra
dition quoted in one of the histories I had read, that this was once a
 fertile and thickly settled countryside. The change, it was said, cam
e simultaneously with the Innsmouth epidemic of 1846, and was thought 
by simple folk to have a dark connexion with hidden forces of evil. Ac
tually, it was caused by the unwise cutting of woodlands near the shor
e, which robbed the soil of its best protection and opened the way for
 waves of wind-blown sand. At last we lost sight of Plum Island and sa
w the vast expanse of the open Atlantic on our left. Our narrow course
 began to climb steeply, and I felt a singular sense of disquiet in lo
oking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky. 
It was as if the bus were about to keep on in its ascent, leaving the 
sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air
 and cryptical sky. The smell of the sea took on ominous implications,
 and the silent driver‚Äôs bent, rigid back and narrow head became mor
e and more hateful. As I looked at him I saw that the back of his head
 was almost as hairless as his face, having only a few straggling yell
ow strands upon a grey scabrous surface. Then we reached the crest and
 beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the Manuxet joins the sea j
ust north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in Kingsport Head 
and veer off toward Cape Ann. On the far, misty horizon I could just m
ake out the dizzy profile of the Head, topped by the queer ancient hou
se of which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my attent
ion was captured by the nearer panorama just below me. I had, I realis
ed, come face to face with rumour-shadowed Innsmouth. It was a town of
 wide extent and dense construction, yet one with a portentous dearth 
of visible life. From the tangle of chimney-pots scarcely a wisp of sm
oke came, and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted again
st the seaward horizon. One of them was crumbling down at the top, and
 in that and another there were only black gaping holes where clock-di
als should have been. The vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and pea
ked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay, 
and as we approached along the now descending road I could see that ma
ny roofs had wholly caved in. There were some large square Georgian ho
uses, too, with hipped roofs, cupolas, and railed ‚Äúwidow‚Äôs walks‚Ä
ù. These were mostly well back from the water, and one or two seemed t
o be in moderately sound condition. Stretching inland from among them 
I saw the rusted, grass-grown line of the abandoned railway, with lean
ing telegraph-poles now devoid of wires, and the half-obscured lines o
f the old carriage roads to Rowley and Ipswich. The decay was worst cl
ose to the waterfront, though in its very midst I could spy the white 
belfry of a fairly well-preserved brick structure which looked like a 
small factory. The harbour, long clogged with sand, was enclosed by an
 ancient stone breakwater; on which I could begin to discern the minut
e forms of a few seated fishermen, and at whose end were what looked l
ike the foundations of a bygone lighthouse. A sandy tongue had formed 
inside this barrier, and upon it I saw a few decrepit cabins, moored d
ories, and scattered lobster-pots. The only deep water seemed to be wh
ere the river poured out past the belfried structure and turned southw
ard to join the ocean at the breakwater‚Äôs end. Here and there the ru
ins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rotte
nness, those farthest south seeming the most decayed. And far out at s
ea, despite a high tide, I glimpsed a long, black line scarcely rising
 above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy. T
his, I knew, must be Devil Reef. As I looked, a subtle, curious sense 
of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough
, I found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression. W
e met no one on the road, but presently began to pass deserted farms i
n varying stages of ruin. Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with r
ags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about
 the littered yards. Once or twice I saw listless-looking people worki
ng in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach belo
w, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged children playing around weed-gr
own doorsteps. Somehow these people seemed more disquieting than the d
ismal buildings, for almost every one had certain peculiarities of fac
e and motions which I instinctively disliked without being able to def
ine or comprehend them. For a second I thought this typical physique s
uggested some picture I had seen, perhaps in a book, under circumstanc
es of particular horror or melancholy; but this pseudo-recollection pa
ssed very quickly. As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch t
he steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness. The lea
ning, unpainted houses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road, and
 displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind
. The panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene, and in spots I 
could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk
 had formerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted, and th
ere were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls to
ld of buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most 
nauseous fishy odour imaginable. Soon cross streets and junctions bega
n to appear; those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved 
squalor and decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed 
grandeur. So far I had seen no people in the town, but there now came 
signs of a sparse habitation‚Äîcurtained windows here and there, and a
n occasional battered motor-car at the curb. Pavement and sidewalks we
re increasingly well defined, and though most of the houses were quite
 old‚Äîwood and brick structures of the early nineteenth century‚Äîthe
y were obviously kept fit for habitation. As an amateur antiquarian I 
almost lost my olfactory disgust and my feeling of menace and repulsio
n amidst this rich, unaltered survival from the past. But I was not to
 reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly
 disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or
 radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of
 a circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared
 hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The structure‚Äôs once white p
aint was now grey and peeling, and the black and gold sign on the pedi
ment was so faded that I could only with difficulty make out the words
 ‚ÄúEsoteric Order of Dagon‚Äù. This, then, was the former Masonic Hal
l now given over to a degraded cult. As I strained to decipher this in
scription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a cracked b
ell across the street, and I quickly turned to look out the window on 
my side of the coach. The sound came from a squat-towered stone church
 of manifestly later date than most of the houses, built in a clumsy G
othic fashion and having a disproportionately high basement with shutt
ered windows. Though the hands of its clock were missing on the side I
 glimpsed, I knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of e
leven. Then suddenly all thoughts of time were blotted out by an onrus
hing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seize
d me before I knew what it really was. The door of the church basement
 was open, revealing a rectangle of blackness inside. And as I looked,
 a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle; burn
ing into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all th
e more maddening because analysis could not shew a single nightmarish 
quality in it. It was a living object‚Äîthe first except the driver th
at I had seen since entering the compact part of the town‚Äîand had I 
been in a steadier mood I would have found nothing whatever of terror 
in it. Clearly, as I realised a moment later, it was the pastor; clad 
in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the Order of Dag
on had modified the ritual of the local churches. The thing which had 
probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of
 bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate 
of the one Miss Tilton had shewn me the previous evening. This, acting
 on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the 
indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it. There was not
, I soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that shuddering to
uch of evil pseudo-memory. Was it not natural that a local mystery cul
t should adopt among its regimentals an unique type of head-dress made
 familiar to the community in some strange way‚Äîperhaps as treasure-t
rove? A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now 
became visible on the sidewalks‚Äîlone individuals, and silent knots o
f two or three. The lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes har
boured small shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or t
wo as we rattled along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more d
istinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge ahead, spanned 
by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge beyond which a large square open
ed out. As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both sides and o
bserved some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part
 way down. The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two 
vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstrea
m on my left. From this point the noise was quite deafening. Then we r
olled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up 
on the right-hand side in front of a tall, cupola-crowned building wit
h remnants of yellow paint and with a half-effaced sign proclaiming it
 to be the Gilman House. I was glad to get out of that bus, and at onc
e proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby. There was on
ly one person in sight‚Äîan elderly man without what I had come to cal
l the ‚ÄúInnsmouth look‚Äù‚Äîand I decided not to ask him any of the q
uestions which bothered me; remembering that odd things had been notic
ed in this hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the square, from which th
e bus had already gone, and studied the scene minutely and appraisingl
y. One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of th
e river; the other was a semicircle of slant-roofed brick buildings of
 about the 1800 period, from which several streets radiated away to th
e southeast, south, and southwest. Lamps were depressingly few and sma
ll‚Äîall low-powered incandescents‚Äîand I was glad that my plans call
ed for departure before dark, even though I knew the moon would be bri
ght. The buildings were all in fair condition, and included perhaps a 
dozen shops in current operation; of which one was a grocery of the Fi
rst National chain, others a dismal restaurant, a drug store, and a wh
olesale fish-dealer‚Äôs office, and still another, at the eastern extr
emity of the square near the river, an office of the town‚Äôs only ind
ustry‚Äîthe Marsh Refining Company. There were perhaps ten people visi
ble, and four or five automobiles and motor trucks stood scattered abo
ut. I did not need to be told that this was the civic centre of Innsmo
uth. Eastward I could catch blue glimpses of the harbour, against whic
h rose the decaying remains of three once beautiful Georgian steeples.
 And toward the shore on the opposite bank of the river I saw the whit
e belfry surmounting what I took to be the Marsh refinery. For some re
ason or other I chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery,
 whose personnel was not likely to be native to Innsmouth. I found a s
olitary boy of about seventeen in charge, and was pleased to note the 
brightness and affability which promised cheerful information. He seem
ed exceptionally eager to talk, and I soon gathered that he did not li
ke the place, its fishy smell, or its furtive people. A word with any 
outsider was a relief to him. He hailed from Arkham, boarded with a fa
mily who came from Ipswich, and went back home whenever he got a momen
t off. His family did not like him to work in Innsmouth, but the chain
 had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job. The
re was, he said, no public library or chamber of commerce in Innsmouth
, but I could probably find my way about. The street I had come down w
as Federal. West of that were the fine old residence streets‚ÄîBroad, 
Washington, Lafayette, and Adams‚Äîand east of it were the shoreward s
lums. It was in these slums‚Äîalong Main Street‚Äîthat I would find th
e old Georgian churches, but they were all long abandoned. It would be
 well not to make oneself too conspicuous in such neighbourhoods‚Äîesp
ecially north of the river‚Äîsince the people were sullen and hostile.
 Some strangers had even disappeared. Certain spots were almost forbid
den territory, as he had learned at considerable cost. One must not, f
or example, linger much around the Marsh refinery, or around any of th
e still used churches, or around the pillared Order of Dagon Hall at N
ew Church Green. Those churches were very odd‚Äîall violently disavowe
d by their respective denominations elsewhere, and apparently using th
e queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments. Their creeds we
re heterodox and mysterious, involving hints of certain marvellous tra
nsformations leading to bodily immortality‚Äîof a sort‚Äîon this earth
. The youth‚Äôs own pastor‚ÄîDr. Wallace of Asbury M. E. Church in Ark
ham‚Äîhad gravely urged him not to join any church in Innsmouth. As fo
r the Innsmouth people‚Äîthe youth hardly knew what to make of them. T
hey were as furtive and seldom seen as animals that live in burrows, a
nd one could hardly imagine how they passed the time apart from their 
desultory fishing. Perhaps‚Äîjudging from the quantities of bootleg li
quor they consumed‚Äîthey lay for most of the daylight hours in an alc
oholic stupor. They seemed sullenly banded together in some sort of fe
llowship and understanding‚Äîdespising the world as if they had access
 to other and preferable spheres of entity. Their appearance‚Äîespecia
lly those staring, unwinking eyes which one never saw shut‚Äîwas certa
inly shocking enough; and their voices were disgusting. It was awful t
o hear them chanting in their churches at night, and especially during
 their main festivals or revivals, which fell twice a year on April 30
th and October 31st. They were very fond of the water, and swam a grea
t deal in both river and harbour. Swimming races out to Devil Reef wer
e very common, and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this
 arduous sport. When one came to think of it, it was generally only ra
ther young people who were seen about in public, and of these the olde
st were apt to be the most tainted-looking. When exceptions did occur,
 they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like the old cle
rk at the hotel. One wondered what became of the bulk of the older fol
k, and whether the ‚ÄúInnsmouth look‚Äù were not a strange and insidio
us disease-phenomenon which increased its hold as years advanced. Only
 a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and ra
dical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity‚Äîchang
es involving osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull‚Äîbut 
then, even this aspect was no more baffling and unheard-of than the vi
sible features of the malady as a whole. It would be hard, the youth i
mplied, to form any real conclusions regarding such a matter; since on
e never came to know the natives personally no matter how long one mig
ht live in Innsmouth. The youth was certain that many specimens even w
orse than the worst visible ones were kept locked indoors in some plac
es. People sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds. The tottering 
waterfront hovels north of the river were reputedly connected by hidde
n tunnels, being thus a veritable warren of unseen abnormalities. What
 kind of foreign blood‚Äîif any‚Äîthese beings had, it was impossible 
to tell. They sometimes kept certain especially repulsive characters o
ut of sight when government agents and others from the outside world c
ame to town. It would be of no use, my informant said, to ask the nati
ves anything about the place. The only one who would talk was a very a
ged but normal-looking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim
 of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the f
ire station. This hoary character, Zadok Allen, was ninety-six years o
ld and somewhat touched in the head, besides being the town drunkard. 
He was a strange, furtive creature who constantly looked over his shou
lder as if afraid of something, and when sober could not be persuaded 
to talk at all with strangers. He was, however, unable to resist any o
ffer of his favourite poison; and once drunk would furnish the most as
tonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence. After all, though, litt
le useful data could be gained from him; since his stories were all in
sane, incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could h
ave no source save in his own disordered fancy. Nobody ever believed h
im, but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with strangers;
 and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him. It was probabl
y from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions wer
e derived. Several non-native residents had reported monstrous glimpse
s from time to time, but between old Zadok‚Äôs tales and the malformed
 denizens it was no wonder such illusions were current. None of the no
n-natives ever stayed out late at night, there being a widespread impr
ession that it was not wise to do so. Besides, the streets were loaths
omely dark. As for business‚Äîthe abundance of fish was certainly almo
st uncanny, but the natives were taking less and less advantage of it.
 Moreover, prices were falling and competition was growing. Of course 
the town‚Äôs real business was the refinery, whose commercial office w
as on the square only a few doors east of where we stood. Old Man Mars
h was never seen, but sometimes went to the works in a closed, curtain
ed car. There were all sorts of rumours about how Marsh had come to lo
ok. He had once been a great dandy, and people said he still wore the 
frock-coated finery of the Edwardian age, curiously adapted to certain
 deformities. His sons had formerly conducted the office in the square
, but latterly they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leav
ing the brunt of affairs to the younger generation. The sons and their
 sisters had come to look very queer, especially the elder ones; and i
t was said that their health was failing. One of the Marsh daughters w
as a repellent, reptilian-looking woman who wore an excess of weird je
wellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the stra
nge tiara belonged. My informant had noticed it many times, and had he
ard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates o
r of daemons. The clergymen‚Äîor priests, or whatever they were called
 nowadays‚Äîalso wore this kind of ornament as a head-dress; but one s
eldom caught glimpses of them. Other specimens the youth had not seen,
 though many were rumoured to exist around Innsmouth. The Marshes, tog
ether with the other three gently bred families of the town‚Äîthe Wait
es, the Gilmans, and the Eliots‚Äîwere all very retiring. They lived i
n immense houses along Washington Street, and several were reputed to 
harbour in concealment certain living kinsfolk whose personal aspect f
orbade public view, and whose deaths had been reported and recorded. W
arning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for 
my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town‚Äô
s salient features. After a moment‚Äôs study I felt sure that it would
 be of great help, and pocketed it with profuse thanks. Disliking the 
dinginess of the single restaurant I had seen, I bought a fair supply 
of cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later on. My 
programme, I decided, would be to thread the principal streets, talk w
ith any non-natives I might encounter, and catch the eight o‚Äôclock c
oach for Arkham. The town, I could see, formed a significant and exagg
erated example of communal decay; but being no sociologist I would lim
it my serious observations to the field of architecture. Thus I began 
my systematic though half-bewildered tour of Innsmouth‚Äôs narrow, sha
dow-blighted ways. Crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of 
the lower falls, I passed close to the Marsh refinery, which seemed od
dly free from the noise of industry. This building stood on the steep 
river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which I to
ok to be the earliest civic centre, displaced after the Revolution by 
the present Town Square. Re-crossing the gorge on the Main Street brid
ge, I struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder
. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic sk
yline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancien
t church. Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were t
ightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping w
indows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incred
ible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those wind
ows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward 
the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in ge
ometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to f
orm a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of f
ishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities
 of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories an
d the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not 
even the stoutest philosophy can disperse. Fish Street was as deserted
 as Main, though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses
 still in excellent shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, save
 that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a livi
ng thing did I see, except for the scattered fishermen on the distant 
breakwater, and not a sound did I hear save the lapping of the harbour
 tides and the roar of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was getting 
more and more on my nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I pick
ed my way back over the tottering Water Street bridge. The Fish Street
 bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins. North of the river the
re were traces of squalid life‚Äîactive fish-packing houses in Water S
treet, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional s
ounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in th
e dismal streets and unpaved lanes‚Äîbut I seemed to find this even mo
re oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one thing, the people 
were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town;
 so that I was several times evilly reminded of something utterly fant
astic which I could not quite place. Undoubtedly the alien strain in t
he Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland‚Äîunless, inde
ed, the ‚ÄúInnsmouth look‚Äù were a disease rather than a blood strain
, in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanc
ed cases. One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few f
aint sounds I heard. They ought naturally to have come wholly from the
 visibly inhabited houses, yet in reality were often strongest inside 
the most rigidly boarded-up facades. There were creakings, scurryings,
 and hoarse doubtful noises; and I thought uncomfortably about the hid
den tunnels suggested by the grocery boy. Suddenly I found myself wond
ering what the voices of those denizens would be like. I had heard no 
speech so far in this quarter, and was unaccountably anxious not to do
 so. Pausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous old chur
ches at Main and Church Streets, I hastened out of that vile waterfron
t slum. My next logical goal was New Church Green, but somehow or othe
r I could not bear to repass the church in whose basement I had glimps
ed the inexplicably frightening form of that strangely diademed priest
 or pastor. Besides, the grocery youth had told me that the churches, 
as well as the Order of Dagon Hall, were not advisable neighbourhoods 
for strangers. Accordingly I kept north along Main to Martin, then tur
ning inland, crossing Federal Street safely north of the Green, and en
tering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern Broad, Washingt
on, Lafayette, and Adams Streets. Though these stately old avenues wer
e ill-surfaced and unkempt, their elm-shaded dignity had not entirely 
departed. Mansion after mansion claimed my gaze, most of them decrepit
 and boarded up amidst neglected grounds, but one or two in each stree
t shewing signs of occupancy. In Washington Street there was a row of 
four or five in excellent repair and with finely tended lawns and gard
ens. The most sumptuous of these‚Äîwith wide terraced parterres extend
ing back the whole way to Lafayette Street‚ÄîI took to be the home of 
Old Man Marsh, the afflicted refinery owner. In all these streets no l
iving thing was visible, and I wondered at the complete absense of cat
s and dogs from Innsmouth. Another thing which puzzled and disturbed m
e, even in some of the best-preserved mansions, was the tightly shutte
red condition of many third-story and attic windows. Furtiveness and s
ecretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and deat
h, and I could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush o
n every hand by sly, staring eyes that never shut. I shivered as the c
racked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left. Too well did 
I recall the squat church from which those notes came. Following Washi
ngton Street toward the river, I now faced a new zone of former indust
ry and commerce; noting the ruins of a factory ahead, and seeing other
s, with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridg
e beyond, up the gorge on my right. The uncertain bridge now before me
 was posted with a warning sign, but I took the risk and crossed again
 to the south bank where traces of life reappeared. Furtive, shambling
 creatures stared cryptically in my direction, and more normal faces e
yed me coldly and curiously. Innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerabl
e, and I turned down Paine Street toward the Square in the hope of get
ting some vehicle to take me to Arkham before the still-distant starti
ng-time of that sinister bus. It was then that I saw the tumbledown fi
re station on my left, and noticed the red-faced, bushy-bearded, water
y-eyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it t
alking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal-looking firemen. This, 
of course, must be Zadok Allen, the half-crazed, liquorish nonagenaria
n whose tales of old Innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incr
edible. III. It must have been some imp of the perverse‚Äîor some sard
onic pull from dark, hidden sources‚Äîwhich made me change my plans as
 I did. I had long before resolved to limit my observations to archite
cture alone, and I was even then hurrying toward the Square in an effo
rt to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and
 decay; but the sight of old Zadok Allen set up new currents in my min
d and made me slacken my pace uncertainly. I had been assured that the
 old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, and incredible
 legends, and I had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be 
seen talking to him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town‚
Äôs decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships and fac
tories, was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist. Afte
r all, the strangest and maddest of myths are often merely symbols or 
allegories based upon truth‚Äîand old Zadok must have seen everything 
which went on around Innsmouth for the last ninety years. Curiosity fl
ared up beyond sense and caution, and in my youthful egotism I fancied
 I might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused, 
extravagant outpouring I would probably extract with the aid of raw wh
iskey. I knew that I could not accost him then and there, for the fire
men would surely notice and object. Instead, I reflected, I would prep
are by getting some bootleg liquor at a place where the grocery boy ha
d told me it was plentiful. Then I would loaf near the fire station in
 apparent casualness, and fall in with old Zadok after he had started 
on one of his frequent rambles. The youth said that he was very restle
ss, seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour or two at 
a time. A quart bottle of whiskey was easily, though not cheaply, obta
ined in the rear of a dingy variety-store just off the Square in Eliot
 Street. The dirty-looking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the 
staring ‚ÄúInnsmouth look‚Äù, but was quite civil in his way; being pe
rhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers‚Äîtruckmen, gold-
buyers, and the like‚Äîas were occasionally in town. Re√´ntering the S
quare I saw that luck was with me; for‚Äîshuffling out of Paine Street
 around the corner of the Gilman House‚ÄîI glimpsed nothing less than 
the tall, lean, tattered form of old Zadok Allen himself. In accordanc
e with my plan, I attracted his attention by brandishing my newly purc
hased bottle; and soon realised that he had begun to shuffle wistfully
 after me as I turned into Waite Street on my way to the most deserted
 region I could think of. I was steering my course by the map the groc
ery boy had prepared, and was aiming for the wholly abandoned stretch 
of southern waterfront which I had previously visited. The only people
 in sight there had been the fishermen on the distant breakwater; and 
by going a few squares south I could get beyond the range of these, fi
nding a pair of seats on some abandoned wharf and being free to questi
on old Zadok unobserved for an indefinite time. Before I reached Main 
Street I could hear a faint and wheezy ‚ÄúHey, Mister!‚Äù behind me, a
nd I presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls 
from the quart bottle. I began putting out feelers as we walked along 
to Water Street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation
 and crazily tilted ruins, but found that the aged tongue did not loos
en as quickly as I had expected. At length I saw a grass-grown opening
 toward the sea between crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length o
f an earth-and-masonry wharf projecting beyond. Piles of moss-covered 
stones near the water promised tolerable seats, and the scene was shel
tered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north. Here,
 I thought, was the ideal place for a long secret colloquy; so I guide
d my companion down the lane and picked out spots to sit in among the 
mossy stones. The air of death and desertion was ghoulish, and the sme
ll of fish almost insufferable; but I was resolved to let nothing dete
r me. About four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch th
e eight o‚Äôclock coach for Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquo
r to the ancient tippler; meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch. In my 
donations I was careful not to overshoot the mark, for I did not wish 
Zadok‚Äôs vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor. After an hour hi
s furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing, but much to my dis
appointment he still sidetracked my questions about Innsmouth and its 
shadow-haunted past. He would babble of current topics, revealing a wi
de acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise i
n a sententious village fashion. Toward the end of the second hour I f
eared my quart of whiskey would not be enough to produce results, and 
was wondering whether I had better leave old Zadok and go back for mor
e. Just then, however, chance made the opening which my questions had 
been unable to make; and the wheezing ancient‚Äôs rambling took a turn
 that caused me to lean forward and listen alertly. My back was toward
 the fishy-smelling sea, but he was facing it, and something or other 
had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of Dev
il Reef, then shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves
. The sight seemed to displease him, for he began a series of weak cur
ses which ended in a confidential whisper and a knowing leer. He bent 
toward me, took hold of my coat lapel, and hissed out some hints that 
could not be mistaken. ‚ÄúThar‚Äôs whar it all begun‚Äîthat cursed pla
ce of all wickedness whar the deep water starts. Gate o‚Äô hell‚Äîshee

their sacrifices, an‚Äô ud reely answer folks‚Äôs prayers. ‚ÄúMatt Eli
ot, his fust mate, talked a lot, too, only he was agin‚Äô folks‚Äôs do
in‚Äô any heathen things. Told abaout an island east of Otaheit√© whar
 they was a lot o‚Äô stone ruins older‚Äôn anybody knew anything abaou
t, kind o‚Äô like them on Ponape, in the Carolines, but with carvin‚Äô
s of faces that looked like the big statues on Easter Island. They was
 a little volcanic island near thar, too, whar they was other ruins wi
th diff‚Äôrent carvin‚Äôs‚Äîruins all wore away like they‚Äôd ben unde
r the sea onct, an‚Äô with picters of awful monsters all over ‚Äôem. ‚
ÄúWal, Sir, Matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish the
y cud ketch, an‚Äô sported bracelets an‚Äô armlets an‚Äô head rigs mad
e aout of a queer kind o‚Äô gold an‚Äô covered with picters o‚Äô monst
ers jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little island‚Äîso
rter fish-like frogs or frog-like fishes that was drawed in all kinds 
o‚Äô positions like they was human bein‚Äôs. Nobody cud git aout o‚Äô 
them whar they got all the stuff, an‚Äô all the other natives wondered
 haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next isla
nds had lean pickin‚Äôs. Matt he got to wonderin‚Äô too, an‚Äô so did 
Cap‚Äôn Obed. Obed he notices, besides, that lots of the han‚Äôsome yo
ung folks ud drop aout o‚Äô sight fer good from year to year, an‚Äô th
at they wa‚Äôn‚Äôt many old folks araound. Also, he thinks some of the
 folks looks durned queer even fer Kanakys. ‚ÄúIt took Obed to git the
 truth aout o‚Äô them heathen. I dun‚Äôt know haow he done it, but he 
begun by tradin‚Äô fer the gold-like things they wore. Ast ‚Äôem whar 
they come from, an‚Äô ef they cud git more, an‚Äô finally wormed the s
tory aout o‚Äô the old chief‚ÄîWalakea, they called him. Nobody but Ob
ed ud ever a believed the old yeller devil, but the Cap‚Äôn cud read f
olks like they was books. Heh, heh! Nobody never believes me naow when
 I tell ‚Äôem, an‚Äô I dun‚Äôt s‚Äôpose you will, young feller‚Äîthoug
h come to look at ye, ye hev kind o‚Äô got them sharp-readin‚Äô eyes l
ike Obed had.‚Äù The old man‚Äôs whisper grew fainter, and I found mys
elf shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his inton
ation, even though I knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phanta
sy. ‚ÄúWal, Sir, Obed he larnt that they‚Äôs things on this arth as mo
st folks never heerd abaout‚Äîan‚Äô wouldn‚Äôt believe ef they did hea
r. It seems these Kanakys was sacrificin‚Äô heaps o‚Äô their young men
 an‚Äô maidens to some kind o‚Äô god-things that lived under the sea, 
an‚Äô gittin‚Äô all kinds o‚Äô favour in return. They met the things o
n the little islet with the queer ruins, an‚Äô it seems them awful pic
ters o‚Äô frog-fish monsters was supposed to be picters o‚Äô these thi
ngs. Mebbe they was the kind o‚Äô critters as got all the mermaid stor
ies an‚Äô sech started. They had all kinds o‚Äô cities on the sea-bott
om, an‚Äô this island was heaved up from thar. Seems they was some of 
the things alive in the stone buildin‚Äôs when the island come up sudd
en to the surface. That‚Äôs haow the Kanakys got wind they was daown t
har. Made sign-talk as soon as they got over bein‚Äô skeert, an‚Äô pie
ced up a bargain afore long. ‚ÄúThem things liked human sacrifices. Ha
d had ‚Äôem ages afore, but lost track o‚Äô the upper world arter a ti
me. What they done to the victims it ain‚Äôt fer me to say, an‚Äô I gu
ess Obed wa‚Äôn‚Äôt none too sharp abaout askin‚Äô. But it was all rig
ht with the heathens, because they‚Äôd ben havin‚Äô a hard time an‚Äô 
was desp‚Äôrate abaout everything. They give a sarten number o‚Äô youn
g folks to the sea-things twict every year‚ÄîMay-Eve an‚Äô Hallowe‚Äôe
n‚Äîreg‚Äôlar as cud be. Also give some o‚Äô the carved knick-knacks t
hey made. What the things agreed to give in return was plenty o‚Äô fis
h‚Äîthey druv ‚Äôem in from all over the sea‚Äîan‚Äô a few gold-like t
hings naow an‚Äô then. ‚ÄúWal, as I says, the natives met the things o
n the little volcanic islet‚Äîgoin‚Äô thar in canoes with the sacrific
es et cet‚Äôry, and bringin‚Äô back any of the gold-like jools as was 
comin‚Äô to ‚Äôem. At fust the things didn‚Äôt never go onto the main 
island, but arter a time they come to want to. Seems they hankered art
er mixin‚Äô with the folks, an‚Äô havin‚Äô j‚Äôint ceremonies on the b
ig days‚ÄîMay-Eve an‚Äô Hallowe‚Äôen. Ye see, they was able to live bo
th in an‚Äô aout o‚Äô water‚Äîwhat they call amphibians, I guess. The 
Kanakys told ‚Äôem as haow folks from the other islands might wanta wi
pe ‚Äôem aout ef they got wind o‚Äô their bein‚Äô thar, but they says 
they dun‚Äôt keer much, because they cud wipe aout the hull brood o‚Äô
 humans ef they was willin‚Äô to bother‚Äîthat is, any as didn‚Äôt hev
 sarten signs sech as was used onct by the lost Old Ones, whoever they
 was. But not wantin‚Äô to bother, they‚Äôd lay low when anybody visit
ed the island. ‚ÄúWhen it come to matin‚Äô with them toad-lookin‚Äô fi
shes, the Kanakys kind o‚Äô balked, but finally they larnt something a
s put a new face on the matter. Seems that human folks has got a kind 
o‚Äô relation to sech water-beasts‚Äîthat everything alive come aout o
‚Äô the water onct, an‚Äô only needs a little change to go back agin. 
Them things told the Kanakys that ef they mixed bloods there‚Äôd be ch
ildren as ud look human at fust, but later turn more‚Äôn more like the
 things, till finally they‚Äôd take to the water an‚Äô jine the main l
ot o‚Äô things daown thar. An‚Äô this is the important part, young fel
ler‚Äîthem as turned into fish things an‚Äô went into the water wouldn
‚Äôt never die. Them things never died excep‚Äô they was kilt violent.
 ‚ÄúWal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was
 all full o‚Äô fish blood from them deep-water things. When they got o
ld an‚Äô begun to shew it, they was kep‚Äô hid until they felt like ta
kin‚Äô to the water an‚Äô quittin‚Äô the place. Some was more teched t
han others, an‚Äô some never did change quite enough to take to the wa
ter; but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said. Them a
s was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly h
uman sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though
 they‚Äôd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that. Folks as 
had took to the water gen‚Äôrally come back a good deal to visit, so‚Ä
ôs a man ud often be a-talkin‚Äô to his own five-times-great-grandfath
er, who‚Äôd left the dry land a couple o‚Äô hundred years or so afore.
 ‚ÄúEverybody got aout o‚Äô the idee o‚Äô dyin‚Äô‚Äîexcep‚Äô in canoe 
wars with the other islanders, or as sacrifices to the sea-gods daown 
below, or from snake-bite or plague or sharp gallopin‚Äô ailments or s
omethin‚Äô afore they cud take to the water‚Äîbut simply looked forrad
 to a kind o‚Äô change that wa‚Äôn‚Äôt a bit horrible arter a while. T
hey thought what they‚Äôd got was well wuth all they‚Äôd had to give u
p‚Äîan‚Äô I guess Obed kind o‚Äô come to think the same hisself when h
e‚Äôd chewed over old Walakea‚Äôs story a bit. Walakea, though, was on
e of the few as hadn‚Äôt got none of the fish blood‚Äîbein‚Äô of a roy
al line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands. ‚ÄúWalake
a he shewed Obed a lot o‚Äô rites an‚Äô incantations as had to do with
 the sea-things, an‚Äô let him see some o‚Äô the folks in the village 
as had changed a lot from human shape. Somehaow or other, though, he n
ever would let him see one of the reg‚Äôlar things from right aout o‚Ä
ô the water. In the end he give him a funny kind o‚Äô thingumajig made
 aout o‚Äô lead or something, that he said ud bring up the fish things
 from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of ‚Äôem. The i
dee was to drop it daown with the right kind o‚Äô prayers an‚Äô sech. 
Walakea allaowed as the things was scattered all over the world, so‚Äô
s anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an‚Äô bring ‚Äôem up ef t
hey was wanted. ‚ÄúMatt he didn‚Äôt like this business at all, an‚Äô w
anted Obed shud keep away from the island; but the Cap‚Äôn was sharp f
er gain, an‚Äô faound he cud git them gold-like things so cheap it ud 
pay him to make a specialty of ‚Äôem. Things went on that way fer year
s, an‚Äô Obed got enough o‚Äô that gold-like stuff to make him start t
he refinery in Waite‚Äôs old run-daown fullin‚Äô mill. He didn‚Äôt das
s sell the pieces like they was, fer folks ud be all the time askin‚Äô
 questions. All the same his crews ud git a piece an‚Äô dispose of it 
naow and then, even though they was swore to keep quiet; an‚Äô he let 
his women-folks wear some o‚Äô the pieces as was more human-like than 
most. ‚ÄúWal, come abaout ‚Äôthutty-eight‚Äîwhen I was seven year‚Äô o
ld‚ÄîObed he faound the island people all wiped aout between v‚Äôyages
. Seems the other islanders had got wind o‚Äô what was goin‚Äô on, an‚
Äô had took matters into their own hands. S‚Äôpose they musta had, art
er all, them old magic signs as the sea-things says was the only thing
s they was afeard of. No tellin‚Äô what any o‚Äô them Kanakys will cha
nce to git a holt of when the sea-bottom throws up some island with ru
ins older‚Äôn the deluge. Pious cusses, these was‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt leav
e nothin‚Äô standin‚Äô on either the main island or the little volcani
c islet excep‚Äô what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown. I
n some places they was little stones strewed abaout‚Äîlike charms‚Äîwi
th somethin‚Äô on ‚Äôem like what ye call a swastika naowadays. Prob‚Ä
ôly them was the Old Ones‚Äô signs. Folks all wiped aout, no trace o‚Ä
ô no gold-like things, an‚Äô none o‚Äô the nearby Kanakys ud breathe a
 word abaout the matter. Wouldn‚Äôt even admit they‚Äôd ever ben any p
eople on that island. ‚ÄúThat naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein‚Äô
 as his normal trade was doin‚Äô very poor. It hit the whole of Innsmo
uth, too, because in seafarin‚Äô days what profited the master of a sh
ip gen‚Äôlly profited the crew proportionate. Most o‚Äô the folks arao
und the taown took the hard times kind o‚Äô sheep-like an‚Äô resigned,
 but they was in bad shape because the fishin‚Äô was peterin‚Äô aout a
n‚Äô the mills wa‚Äôn‚Äôt doin‚Äô none too well. ‚ÄúThen‚Äôs the time 
Obed he begun a-cursin‚Äô at the folks fer bein‚Äô dull sheep an‚Äô pr
ayin‚Äô to a Christian heaven as didn‚Äôt help ‚Äôem none. He told ‚Äô
em he‚Äôd knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin‚Äô ye r
eely need, an‚Äô says ef a good bunch o‚Äô men ud stand by him, he cud
 mebbe git a holt o‚Äô sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o‚Äô fish an‚
Äô quite a bit o‚Äô gold. O‚Äô course them as sarved on the Sumatry Qu
een an‚Äô seed the island knowed what he meant, an‚Äô wa‚Äôn‚Äôt none 
too anxious to git clost to sea-things like they‚Äôd heerd tell on, bu
t them as didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äôtwas all abaout got kind o‚Äô swayed b
y what Obed had to say, an‚Äô begun to ast him what he cud do to set ‚
Äôem on the way to the faith as ud bring ‚Äôem results.‚Äù Here the ol
d man faltered, mumbled, and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive sile
nce; glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to sta
re fascinatedly at the distant black reef. When I spoke to him he did 
not answer, so I knew I would have to let him finish the bottle. The i
nsane yarn I was hearing interested me profoundly, for I fancied there
 was contained within it a sort of crude allegory based upon the stran
genesses of Innsmouth and elaborated by an imagination at once creativ
e and full of scraps of exotic legend. Not for a moment did I believe 
that the tale had any really substantial foundation; but none the less
 the account held a hint of genuine terror, if only because it brought
 in references to strange jewels clearly akin to the malign tiara I ha
d seen at Newburyport. Perhaps the ornaments had, after all, come from
 some strange island; and possibly the wild stories were lies of the b
ygone Obed himself rather than of this antique toper. I handed Zadok t
he bottle, and he drained it to the last drop. It was curious how he c
ould stand so much whiskey, for not even a trace of thickness had come
 into his high, wheezy voice. He licked the nose of the bottle and sli
pped it into his pocket, then beginning to nod and whisper softly to h
imself. I bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter, and
 thought I saw a sardonic smile behind the stained, bushy whiskers. Ye
s‚Äîhe was really forming words, and I could grasp a fair proportion o
f them. ‚ÄúPoor Matt‚ÄîMatt he allus was agin‚Äô it‚Äîtried to line up
 the folks on his side, an‚Äô had long talks with the preachers‚Äîno u
se‚Äîthey run the Congregational parson aout o‚Äô taown, an‚Äô the Met
hodist feller quit‚Äînever did see Resolved Babcock, the Baptist parso
n, agin‚ÄîWrath o‚Äô Jehovy‚ÄîI was a mighty little critter, but I hee

 Philistines‚ÄîBabylonish abominations‚ÄîMene, mene, tekel, upharsin‚Ä
î‚Äù He stopped again, and from the look in his watery blue eyes I fea
red he was close to a stupor after all. But when I gently shook his sh
oulder he turned on me with astonishing alertness and snapped out some
 more obscure phrases. ‚ÄúDun‚Äôt believe me, hey? Heh, heh, heh‚Äîthe
n jest tell me, young feller, why Cap‚Äôn Obed an‚Äô twenty odd other 
folks used to row aout to Devil Reef in the dead o‚Äô night an‚Äô chan
t things so laoud ye cud hear ‚Äôem all over taown when the wind was r
ight? Tell me that, hey? An‚Äô tell me why Obed was allus droppin‚Äô h
eavy things daown into the deep water t‚Äôother side o‚Äô the reef wha
r the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lower‚Äôn ye kin saound? Tell m
e what he done with that funny-shaped lead thingumajig as Walakea give
 him? Hey, boy? An‚Äô what did they all haowl on May-Eve, an‚Äô agin t
he next Hallowe‚Äôen? An‚Äô why‚Äôd the new church parsons‚Äîfellers a
s used to be sailors‚Äîwear them queer robes an‚Äô cover theirselves w
ith them gold-like things Obed brung? Hey?‚Äù The watery blue eyes wer
e almost savage and maniacal now, and the dirty white beard bristled e
lectrically. Old Zadok probably saw me shrink back, for he had begun t
o cackle evilly. ‚ÄúHeh, heh, heh, heh! Beginnin‚Äô to see, hey? Mebbe
 ye‚Äôd like to a ben me in them days, when I seed things at night aou
t to sea from the cupalo top o‚Äô my haouse. Oh, I kin tell ye, little
 pitchers hev big ears, an‚Äô I wa‚Äôn‚Äôt missin‚Äô nothin‚Äô o‚Äô wh
at was gossiped abaout Cap‚Äôn Obed an‚Äô the folks aout to the reef! 
Heh, heh, heh! Haow abaout the night I took my pa‚Äôs ship‚Äôs glass u
p to the cupalo an‚Äô seed the reef a-bristlin‚Äô thick with shapes th
at dove off quick soon‚Äôs the moon riz? Obed an‚Äô the folks was in a
 dory, but them shapes dove off the far side into the deep water an‚Äô
 never come up. . . . Haow‚Äôd ye like to be a little shaver alone up 
in a cupalo a-watchin‚Äô shapes as wa‚Äôn‚Äôt human shapes? . . . Hey?
 . . . Heh, heh, heh, heh. . . .‚Äù The old man was getting hysterical
, and I began to shiver with a nameless alarm. He laid a gnarled claw 
on my shoulder, and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogethe
r that of mirth. ‚ÄúS‚Äôpose one night ye seed somethin‚Äô heavy heave
d offen Obed‚Äôs dory beyond the reef, an‚Äô then larned nex‚Äô day a 
young feller was missin‚Äô from home? Hey? Did anybody ever see hide o
r hair o‚Äô Hiram Gilman agin? Did they? An‚Äô Nick Pierce, an‚Äô Luel
ly Waite, an‚Äô Adoniram Saouthwick, an‚Äô Henry Garrison? Hey? Heh, h
eh, heh, heh. . . . Shapes talkin‚Äô sign language with their hands . 
. . them as had reel hands. . . . ‚ÄúWal, Sir, that was the time Obed 
begun to git on his feet agin. Folks see his three darters a-wearin‚Äô
 gold-like things as nobody‚Äôd never see on ‚Äôem afore, an‚Äô smoke 
started comin‚Äô aout o‚Äô the refin‚Äôry chimbly. Other folks were pr
osp‚Äôrin‚Äô, too‚Äîfish begun to swarm into the harbour fit to kill, 
an‚Äô heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to Newb‚Äô
ryport, Arkham, an‚Äô Boston. ‚ÄôTwas then Obed got the ol‚Äô branch r
ailrud put through. Some Kingsport fishermen heerd abaout the ketch an
‚Äô come up in sloops, but they was all lost. Nobody never see ‚Äôem a
gin. An‚Äô jest then our folks organised the Esoteric Order o‚Äô Dagon
, an‚Äô bought Masonic Hall offen Calvary Commandery for it . . . heh,
 heh, heh! Matt Eliot was a Mason an‚Äô agin‚Äô the sellin‚Äô, but he 
dropped aout o‚Äô sight jest then. ‚ÄúRemember, I ain‚Äôt sayin‚Äô Obe
d was set on hevin‚Äô things jest like they was on that Kanaky isle. I
 dun‚Äôt think he aimed at fust to do no mixin‚Äô, nor raise no youngu
ns to take to the water an‚Äô turn into fishes with eternal life. He w
anted them gold things, an‚Äô was willin‚Äô to pay heavy, an‚Äô I gues
s the others was satisfied fer a while. . . . ‚ÄúCome in ‚Äôforty-six 
the taown done some lookin‚Äô an‚Äô thinkin‚Äô fer itself. Too many fo
lks missin‚Äô‚Äîtoo much wild preachin‚Äô at meetin‚Äô of a Sunday‚Äît
oo much talk abaout that reef. I guess I done a bit by tellin‚Äô Selec
tman Mowry what I see from the cupalo. They was a party one night as f
ollered Obed‚Äôs craowd aout to the reef, an‚Äô I heerd shots betwixt 
the dories. Nex‚Äô day Obed an‚Äô thutty-two others was in gaol, with 
everbody a-wonderin‚Äô jest what was afoot an‚Äô jest what charge agin
‚Äô ‚Äôem cud be got to holt. God, ef anybody‚Äôd look‚Äôd ahead . . .
 a couple o‚Äô weeks later, when nothin‚Äô had ben throwed into the se
a fer that long. . . .‚Äù Zadok was shewing signs of fright and exhaus
tion, and I let him keep silence for a while, though glancing apprehen
sively at my watch. The tide had turned and was coming in now, and the
 sound of the waves seemed to arouse him. I was glad of that tide, for
 at high water the fishy smell might not be so bad. Again I strained t
o catch his whispers. ‚ÄúThat awful night . . . I seed ‚Äôem . . . I w

 was now very insistent, and little by little it seemed to change the 
old man‚Äôs mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear. He would p
ause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or 
out toward the reef, and despite the wild absurdity of his tale, I cou
ld not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness. Zadok now g
rew shriller, and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with loud
er speech. ‚ÄúHey, yew, why dun‚Äôt ye say somethin‚Äô? Haow‚Äôd ye li

HH. . . .‚Äù The hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the o
ld man‚Äôs shriek almost made me faint. His eyes, looking past me towa
rd the malodorous sea, were positively starting from his head; while h
is face was a mask of fear worthy of Greek tragedy. His bony claw dug 
monstrously into my shoulder, and he made no motion as I turned my hea
d to look at whatever he had glimpsed. There was nothing that I could 
see. Only the incoming tide, with perhaps one set of ripples more loca
l than the long-flung line of breakers. But now Zadok was shaking me, 
and I turned back to watch the melting of that fear-frozen face into a
 chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums. Presently his voice cam
e back‚Äîalbeit as a trembling whisper. ‚ÄúGit aout o‚Äô here! Git aou
t o‚Äô here! They seen us‚Äîgit aout fer your life! Dun‚Äôt wait fer n
othin‚Äô‚Äîthey know naow‚Äî Run fer it‚Äîquick‚Äîaout o‚Äô this taown
‚Äî‚Äù Another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the 
bygone wharf, and changed the mad ancient‚Äôs whisper to another inhum
an and blood-curdling scream. ‚ÄúE‚ÄîYAAHHHH! . . . YHAAAAAAA! . . .‚Ä
ù Before I could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch o
n my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street, reeling nort
hward around the ruined warehouse wall. I glanced back at the sea, but
 there was nothing there. And when I reached Water Street and looked a
long it toward the north there was no remaining trace of Zadok Allen. 
IV. I can hardly describe the mood in which I was left by this harrowi
ng episode‚Äîan episode at once mad and pitiful, grotesque and terrify
ing. The grocery boy had prepared me for it, yet the reality left me n
one the less bewildered and disturbed. Puerile though the story was, o
ld Zadok‚Äôs insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mo
unting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the t
own and its blight of intangible shadow. Later I might sift the tale a
nd extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I wished to put
 it out of my head. The hour had grown perilously late‚Äîmy watch said
 7:15, and the Arkham bus left Town Square at eight‚Äîso I tried to gi
ve my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible, meanwhile 
walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leani
ng houses toward the hotel where I had checked my valise and would fin
d my bus. Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient r
oofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace, I co
uld not help glancing over my shoulder now and then. I would surely be
 very glad to get out of malodorous and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and w
ished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinist
er-looking fellow Sargent. Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for 
there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner;
 and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a h
alf-hour. Studying the grocery youth‚Äôs map and seeking a route I had
 not traversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my ap
proach to Town Square. Near the corner of Fall Street I began to see s
cattered groups of furtive whisperers, and when I finally reached the 
Square I saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the
 door of the Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwin
king eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, and 
I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow-pas
sengers on the coach. The bus, rather early, rattled in with three pas
sengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidew
alk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent thre
w out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; whil
e the passengers‚Äîthe same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburypor
t that morning‚Äîshambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint gut
tural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not Eng
lish. I boarded the empty coach and took the same seat I had taken bef
ore, but was hardly settled before Sargent reappeared and began mumbli
ng in a throaty voice of peculiar repulsiveness. I was, it appeared, i
n very bad luck. There had been something wrong with the engine, despi
te the excellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could not com
plete the journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired tha
t night, nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of 
Innsmouth, either to Arkham or elsewhere. Sargent was sorry, but I wou
ld have to stop over at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make the 
price easy for me, but there was nothing else to do. Almost dazed by t
his sudden obstacle, and violently dreading the fall of night in this 
decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the bus and re√´ntered the ho
tel lobby; where the sullen, queer-looking night clerk told me I could
 have Room 428 on next the top floor‚Äîlarge, but without running wate
r‚Äîfor a dollar. Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburypor
t, I signed the register, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my valise
, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights
 of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life. My
 room, a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings,
 overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted bri
ck blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward-stretching roofs 
with a marshy countryside beyond. At the end of the corridor was a bat
hroom‚Äîa discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, fain
t electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing f
ixtures. It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and looked
 around for a dinner of some sort; noticing as I did so the strange gl
ances I received from the unwholesome loafers. Since the grocery was c
losed, I was forced to patronise the restaurant I had shunned before; 
a stooped, narrow-headed man with staring, unwinking eyes, and a flat-
nosed wench with unbelievably thick, clumsy hands being in attendance.
 The service was of the counter type, and it relieved me to find that 
much was evidently served from cans and packages. A bowl of vegetable 
soup with crackers was enough for me, and I soon headed back for my ch
eerless room at the Gilman; getting an evening paper and a flyspecked 
magazine from the evil-visaged clerk at the rickety stand beside his d
esk. As twilight deepened I turned on the one feeble electric bulb ove
r the cheap, iron-framed bed, and tried as best I could to continue th
e reading I had begun. I felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely
 occupied, for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this
 ancient, blight-shadowed town while I was still within its borders. T
he insane yarn I had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very
 pleasant dreams, and I felt I must keep the image of his wild, watery
 eyes as far as possible from my imagination. Also, I must not dwell o
n what that factory inspector had told the Newburyport ticket-agent ab
out the Gilman House and the voices of its nocturnal tenants‚Äînot on 
that, nor on the face beneath the tiara in the black church doorway; t
he face for whose horror my conscious mind could not account. It would
 perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics h
ad the room not been so gruesomely musty. As it was, the lethal mustin
ess blended hideously with the town‚Äôs general fishy odour and persis
tently focussed one‚Äôs fancy on death and decay. Another thing that d
isturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room. One had 
been there, as marks clearly shewed, but there were signs of recent re
moval. No doubt it had become out of order, like so many other things 
in this decrepit edifice. In my nervousness I looked around and discov
ered a bolt on the clothes-press which seemed to be of the same size, 
judging from the marks, as the one formerly on the door. To gain a par
tial relief from the general tension I busied myself by transferring t
his hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy three-in-one 
device including a screw-driver which I kept on my key-ring. The bolt 
fitted perfectly, and I was somewhat relieved when I knew that I could
 shoot it firmly upon retiring. Not that I had any real apprehension o
f its need, but that any symbol of security was welcome in an environm
ent of this kind. There were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors t
o connecting rooms, and these I proceeded to fasten. I did not undress
, but decided to read till I was sleepy and then lie down with only my
 coat, collar, and shoes off. Taking a pocket flashlight from my valis
e, I placed it in my trousers, so that I could read my watch if I woke
 up later in the dark. Drowsiness, however, did not come; and when I s
topped to analyse my thoughts I found to my disquiet that I was really
 unconsciously listening for something‚Äîlistening for something which
 I dreaded but could not name. That inspector‚Äôs story must have work
ed on my imagination more deeply than I had suspected. Again I tried t
o read, but found that I made no progress. After a time I seemed to he
ar the stairs and corridors creak at intervals as if with footsteps, a
nd wondered if the other rooms were beginning to fill up. There were n
o voices, however, and it struck me that there was something subtly fu
rtive about the creaking. I did not like it, and debated whether I had
 better try to sleep at all. This town had some queer people, and ther
e had undoubtedly been several disappearances. Was this one of those i
nns where travellers were slain for their money? Surely I had no look 
of excessive prosperity. Or were the townsfolk really so resentful abo
ut curious visitors? Had my obvious sightseeing, with its frequent map
-consultations, aroused unfavourable notice? It occurred to me that I 
must be in a highly nervous state to let a few random creakings set me
 off speculating in this fashion‚Äîbut I regretted none the less that 
I was unarmed. At length, feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drows
iness in it, I bolted the newly outfitted hall door, turned off the li
ght, and threw myself down on the hard, uneven bed‚Äîcoat, collar, sho
es, and all. In the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed mag
nified, and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me. I was
 sorry I had put out the light, yet was too tired to rise and turn it 
on again. Then, after a long, dreary interval, and prefaced by a fresh
 creaking of stairs and corridor, there came that soft, damnably unmis
takable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehen
sions. Without the least shadow of a doubt, the lock on my hall door w
as being tried‚Äîcautiously, furtively, tentatively‚Äîwith a key. My s
ensations upon recognising this sign of actual peril were perhaps less
 rather than more tumultuous because of my previous vague fears. I had
 been, albeit without definite reason, instinctively on my guard‚Äîand
 that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it migh
t turn out to be. Nevertheless the change in the menace from vague pre
monition to immediate reality was a profound shock, and fell upon me w
ith the force of a genuine blow. It never once occurred to me that the
 fumbling might be a mere mistake. Malign purpose was all I could thin
k of, and I kept deathly quiet, awaiting the would-be intruder‚Äôs nex
t move. After a time the cautious rattling ceased, and I heard the roo
m to the north entered with a pass-key. Then the lock of the connectin
g door to my room was softly tried. The bolt held, of course, and I he
ard the floor creak as the prowler left the room. After a moment there
 came another soft rattling, and I knew that the room to the south of 
me was being entered. Again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting do
or, and again a receding creaking. This time the creaking went along t
he hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised t
he bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a gr
eater or lesser time, as the future would shew. The readiness with whi
ch I fell into a plan of action proves that I must have been subconsci
ously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape f
or hours. From the first I felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger
 not to be met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as precipitatel
y as possible. The one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive 
as quickly as I could, and through some channel other than the front s
tairs and lobby. Rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switc
h, I sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocke
t some belongings for a swift, valiseless flight. Nothing, however, ha
ppened; and I saw that the power had been cut off. Clearly, some crypt
ic, evil movement was afoot on a large scale‚Äîjust what, I could not 
say. As I stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch I hea
rd a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I could barely d
istinguish voices in conversation. A moment later I felt less sure tha
t the deeper sounds were voices, since the apparent hoarse barkings an
d loose-syllabled croakings bore so little resemblance to recognised h
uman speech. Then I thought with renewed force of what the factory ins
pector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential buil
ding. Having filled my pockets with the flashlight‚Äôs aid, I put on m
y hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent. Despi
te the state‚Äôs safety regulations there was no fire escape on this s
ide of the hotel, and I saw that my windows commanded only a sheer thr
ee-story drop to the cobbled courtyard. On the right and left, however
, some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant
 roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourth-story
 level. To reach either of these lines of buildings I would have to be
 in a room two doors from my own‚Äîin one case on the north and in the
 other case on the south‚Äîand my mind instantly set to work calculati
ng what chances I had of making the transfer. I could not, I decided, 
risk an emergence into the corridor; where my footsteps would surely b
e heard, and where the difficulties of entering the desired room would
 be insuperable. My progress, if it was to be made at all, would have 
to be through the less solidly built connecting doors of the rooms; th
e locks and bolts of which I would have to force violently, using my s
houlder as a battering-ram whenever they were set against me. This, I 
thought, would be possible owing to the rickety nature of the house an
d its fixtures; but I realised I could not do it noiselessly. I would 
have to count on sheer speed, and the chance of getting to a window be
fore any hostile forces became co√∂rdinated enough to open the right d
oor toward me with a pass-key. My own outer door I reinforced by pushi
ng the bureau against it‚Äîlittle by little, in order to make a minimu
m of sound. I perceived that my chances were very slender, and was ful
ly prepared for any calamity. Even getting to another roof would not s
olve the problem, for there would then remain the task of reaching the
 ground and escaping from the town. One thing in my favour was the des
erted and ruinous state of the abutting buildings, and the number of s
kylights gaping blackly open in each row. Gathering from the grocery b
oy‚Äôs map that the best route out of town was southward, I glanced fi
rst at the connecting door on the south side of the room. It was desig
ned to open in my direction, hence I saw‚Äîafter drawing the bolt and 
finding other fastenings in place‚Äîit was not a favourable one for fo
rcing. Accordingly abandoning it as a route, I cautiously moved the be
dstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later
 from the next room. The door on the north was hung to open away from 
me, and this‚Äîthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the
 other side‚ÄîI knew must be my route. If I could gain the roofs of th
e buildings in Paine Street and descend successfully to the ground lev
el, I might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opp
osite buildings to Washington or Bates‚Äîor else emerge in Paine and e
dge around southward into Washington. In any case, I would aim to stri
ke Washington somehow and get quickly out of the Town Square region. M
y preference would be to avoid Paine, since the fire station there mig
ht be open all night. As I thought of these things I looked out over t
he squalid sea of decaying roofs below me, now brightened by the beams
 of a moon not much past full. On the right the black gash of the rive
r-gorge clove the panorama; abandoned factories and railway station cl
inging barnacle-like to its sides. Beyond it the rusted railway and th
e Rowley road led off through a flat, marshy terrain dotted with islet
s of higher and dryer scrub-grown land. On the left the creek-threaded
 countryside was nearer, the narrow road to Ipswich gleaming white in 
the moonlight. I could not see from my side of the hotel the southward
 route toward Arkham which I had determined to take. I was irresolutel
y speculating on when I had better attack the northward door, and on h
ow I could least audibly manage it, when I noticed that the vague nois
es underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the st
airs. A wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom, and the b
oards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load. Muffled so
unds of possible vocal origin approached, and at length a firm knock c
ame at my outer door. For a moment I simply held my breath and waited.
 Eternities seemed to elapse, and the nauseous fishy odour of my envir
onment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly. Then the knocking w
as repeated‚Äîcontinuously, and with growing insistence. I knew that t
he time for action had come, and forthwith drew the bolt of the northw
ard connecting door, bracing myself for the task of battering it open.
 The knocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its volume would cover th
e sound of my efforts. At last beginning my attempt, I lunged again an
d again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder, heedless of shock
 or pain. The door resisted even more than I had expected, but I did n
ot give in. And all the while the clamour at the outer door increased.
 Finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that I knew t
hose outside must have heard. Instantly the outside knocking became a 
violent battering, while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of t
he rooms on both sides of me. Rushing through the newly opened connexi
on, I succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock cou
ld be turned; but even as I did so I heard the hall door of the third 
room‚Äîthe one from whose window I had hoped to reach the roof below‚Ä
îbeing tried with a pass-key. For an instant I felt absolute despair, 
since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete. 
A wave of almost abnormal horror swept over me, and invested with a te
rrible but unexplainable singularity the flashlight-glimpsed dust prin
ts made by the intruder who had lately tried my door from this room. T
hen, with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness, I m
ade for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pus
hing at it in an effort to get through and‚Äîgranting that fastenings 
might be as providentially intact as in this second room‚Äîbolt the ha
ll door beyond before the lock could be turned from outside. Sheer for
tunate chance gave me my reprieve‚Äîfor the connecting door before me 
was not only unlocked but actually ajar. In a second I was through, an
d had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly
 opening inward. My pressure took the opener off guard, for the thing 
shut as I pushed, so that I could slip the well-conditioned bolt as I 
had done with the other door. As I gained this respite I heard the bat
tering at the two other doors abate, while a confused clatter came fro
m the connecting door I had shielded with the bedstead. Evidently the 
bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing 
in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass-key sounded in the 
next door to the north, and I knew that a nearer peril was at hand. Th
e northward connecting door was wide open, but there was no time to th
ink about checking the already turning lock in the hall. All I could d
o was to shut and bolt the open connecting door, as well as its mate o
n the opposite side‚Äîpushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau 
against the other, and moving a washstand in front of the hall door. I
 must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till I cou
ld get out the window and on the roof of the Paine Street block. But e
ven in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the 
immediate weakness of my defences. I was shuddering because not one of
 my pursuers, despite some hideous pantings, gruntings, and subdued ba
rkings at odd intervals, was uttering an unmuffled or intelligible voc
al sound. As I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I hea
rd a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of m
e, and perceived that the southward battering had ceased. Plainly, mos
t of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connect
ing door which they knew must open directly on me. Outside, the moon p
layed on the ridgepole of the block below, and I saw that the jump wou
ld be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which I mu
st land. Surveying the conditions, I chose the more southerly of the t
wo windows as my avenue of escape; planning to land on the inner slope
 of the roof and make for the nearest skylight. Once inside one of the
 decrepit brick structures I would have to reckon with pursuit; but I 
hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the sh
adowed courtyard, eventually getting to Washington Street and slipping
 out of town toward the south. The clatter at the northerly connecting
 door was now terrific, and I saw that the weak panelling was beginnin
g to splinter. Obviously, the besiegers had brought some ponderous obj
ect into play as a battering-ram. The bedstead, however, still held fi
rm; so that I had at least a faint chance of making good my escape. As
 I opened the window I noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour dra
peries suspended from a pole by brass rings, and also that there was a
 large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior. Seeing a pos
sible means of avoiding the dangerous jump, I yanked at the hangings a
nd brought them down, pole and all; then quickly hooking two of the ri
ngs in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside. The heavy f
olds reached fully to the abutting roof, and I saw that the rings and 
catch would be likely to bear my weight. So, climbing out of the windo
w and down the improvised rope ladder, I left behind me forever the mo
rbid and horror-infested fabric of the Gilman House. I landed safely o
n the loose slates of the steep roof, and succeeded in gaining the gap
ing black skylight without a slip. Glancing up at the window I had lef
t, I observed it was still dark, though far across the crumbling chimn
eys to the north I could see lights ominously blazing in the Order of 
Dagon Hall, the Baptist church, and the Congregational church which I 
recalled so shiveringly. There had seemed to be no one in the courtyar
d below, and I hoped there would be a chance to get away before the sp
reading of a general alarm. Flashing my pocket lamp into the skylight,
 I saw that there were no steps down. The distance was slight, however
, so I clambered over the brink and dropped; striking a dusty floor li
ttered with crumbling boxes and barrels. The place was ghoulish-lookin
g, but I was past minding such impressions and made at once for the st
aircase revealed by my flashlight‚Äîafter a hasty glance at my watch, 
which shewed the hour to be 2 a.m. The steps creaked, but seemed toler
ably sound; and I raced down past a barn-like second story to the grou
nd floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes answered my foo
tfalls. At length I reached the lower hall, at one end of which I saw 
a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway. He
ading the other way, I found the back door also open; and darted out a
nd down five stone steps to the grass-grown cobblestones of the courty
ard. The moonbeams did not reach down here, but I could just see my wa
y about without using the flashlight. Some of the windows on the Gilma
n House side were faintly glowing, and I thought I heard confused soun
ds within. Walking softly over to the Washington Street side I perceiv
ed several open doorways, and chose the nearest as my route out. The h
allway inside was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw tha
t the street door was wedged immovably shut. Resolved to try another b
uilding, I groped my way back toward the courtyard, but stopped short 
when close to the doorway. For out of an opened door in the Gilman Hou
se a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouring‚Äîlanterns bobbing in 
the darkness, and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in wha
t was certainly not English. The figures moved uncertainly, and I real
ised to my relief that they did not know where I had gone; but for all
 that they sent a shiver of horror through my frame. Their features we
re indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling gait was abominab
ly repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one figure was strang
ely robed, and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design alt
ogether too familiar. As the figures spread throughout the courtyard, 
I felt my fears increase. Suppose I could find no egress from this bui
lding on the street side? The fishy odour was detestable, and I wonder
ed I could stand it without fainting. Again groping toward the street,
 I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely
 shuttered but sashless windows. Fumbling in the rays of my flashlight
, I found I could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed
 outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner
. I was now in Washington Street, and for the moment saw no living thi
ng nor any light save that of the moon. From several directions in the
 distance, however, I could hear the sound of hoarse voices, of footst
eps, and of a curious kind of pattering which did not sound quite like
 footsteps. Plainly I had no time to lose. The points of the compass w
ere clear to me, and I was glad that all the street-lights were turned
 off, as is often the custom on strongly moonlit nights in unprosperou
s rural regions. Some of the sounds came from the south, yet I retaine
d my design of escaping in that direction. There would, I knew, be ple
nty of deserted doorways to shelter me in case I met any person or gro
up who looked like pursuers. I walked rapidly, softly, and close to th
e ruined houses. While hatless and dishevelled after my arduous climb,
 I did not look especially noticeable; and stood a good chance of pass
ing unheeded if forced to encounter any casual wayfarer. At Bates Stre
et I drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed
 in front of me, but was soon on my way again and approaching the open
 space where Eliot Street obliquely crosses Washington at the intersec
tion of South. Though I had never seen this space, it had looked dange
rous to me on the grocery youth‚Äôs map; since the moonlight would hav
e free play there. There was no use trying to evade it, for any altern
ative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility a
nd delaying effect. The only thing to do was to cross it boldly and op
enly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk as best I co
uld, and trusting that no one‚Äîor at least no pursuer of mine‚Äîwould
 be there. Just how fully the pursuit was organised‚Äîand indeed, just
 what its purpose might be‚ÄîI could form no idea. There seemed to be 
unusual activity in the town, but I judged that the news of my escape 
from the Gilman had not yet spread. I would, of course, soon have to s
hift from Washington to some other southward street; for that party fr
om the hotel would doubtless be after me. I must have left dust prints
 in that last old building, revealing how I had gained the street. The
 open space was, as I had expected, strongly moonlit; and I saw the re
mains of a park-like, iron-railed green in its centre. Fortunately no 
one was about, though a curious sort of buzz or roar seemed to be incr
easing in the direction of Town Square. South Street was very wide, le
ading directly down a slight declivity to the waterfront and commandin
g a long view out at sea; and I hoped that no one would be glancing up
 it from afar as I crossed in the bright moonlight. My progress was un
impeded, and no fresh sound arose to hint that I had been spied. Glanc
ing about me, I involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take
 in the sight of the sea, gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the str
eet‚Äôs end. Far out beyond the breakwater was the dim, dark line of D
evil Reef, and as I glimpsed it I could not help thinking of all the h
ideous legends I had heard in the last thirty-four hours‚Äîlegends whi
ch portrayed this ragged rock as a veritable gateway to realms of unfa
thomed horror and inconceivable abnormality. Then, without warning, I 
saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef. They were d
efinite and unmistakable, and awaked in my mind a blind horror beyond 
all rational proportion. My muscles tightened for panic flight, held i
n only by a certain unconscious caution and half-hypnotic fascination.
 And to make matters worse, there now flashed forth from the lofty cup
ola of the Gilman House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a
 series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be n
othing less than an answering signal. Controlling my muscles, and real
ising afresh how plainly visible I was, I resumed my brisker and feign
edly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominou
s reef as long as the opening of South Street gave me a seaward view. 
What the whole proceeding meant, I could not imagine; unless it involv
ed some strange rite connected with Devil Reef, or unless some party h
ad landed from a ship on that sinister rock. I now bent to the left ar
ound the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in 
the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of 
those nameless, unexplainable beacons. It was then that the most horri
ble impression of all was borne in upon me‚Äîthe impression which dest
royed my last vestige of self-control and set me running frantically s
outhward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows o
f that deserted nightmare street. For at a closer glance I saw that th
e moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty. T
hey were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward t
he town; and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perce
ption I could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien
 and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formula
ted. My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my
 left I began to hear something like the hue and cry of organised purs
uit. There were footsteps and guttural sounds, and a rattling motor wh
eezed south along Federal Street. In a second all my plans were utterl
y changed‚Äîfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I m
ust clearly find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into
 a gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the moonlit
 open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street. A sec
ond reflection was less comforting. Since the pursuit was down another
 street, it was plain that the party was not following me directly. It
 had not seen me, but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off
 my escape. This, however, implied that all roads leading out of Innsm
outh were similarly patrolled; for the denizens could not have known w
hat route I intended to take. If this were so, I would have to make my
 retreat across country away from any road; but how could I do that in
 view of the marshy and creek-riddled nature of all the surrounding re
gion? For a moment my brain reeled‚Äîboth from sheer hopelessness and 
from a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odour. Then I thought o
f the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose solid line of ballasted, weed
-grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling s
tation on the edge of the river-gorge. There was just a chance that th
e townsfolk would not think of that; since its brier-choked desertion 
made it half-impassable, and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugi
tive to choose. I had seen it clearly from my hotel window, and knew a
bout how it lay. Most of its earlier length was uncomfortably visible 
from the Rowley road, and from high places in the town itself; but one
 could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth. At any r
ate, it would form my only chance of deliverance, and there was nothin
g to do but try it. Drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I 
once more consulted the grocery boy‚Äôs map with the aid of the flashl
ight. The immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and 
I now saw that the safest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west
 to Lafayette‚Äîthere edging around but not crossing an open space hom
ologous to the one I had traversed‚Äîand subsequently back northward a
nd westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams, and 
Bank Streets‚Äîthe latter skirting the river-gorge‚Äîto the abandoned 
and dilapidated station I had seen from my window. My reason for going
 ahead to Babson was that I wished neither to re-cross the earlier ope
n space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad 
as South. Starting once more, I crossed the street to the right-hand s
ide in order to edge around into Babson as inconspicuously as possible
. Noises still continued in Federal Street, and as I glanced behind me
 I thought I saw a gleam of light near the building through which I ha
d escaped. Anxious to leave Washington Street, I broke into a quiet do
g-trot, trusting to luck not to encounter any observing eye. Next the 
corner of Babson Street I saw to my alarm that one of the houses was s
till inhabited, as attested by curtains at the window; but there were 
no lights within, and I passed it without disaster. In Babson Street, 
which crossed Federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers, I clu
ng as closely as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice paus
ing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased. The op
en space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon, but my route wo
uld not force me to cross it. During my second pause I began to detect
 a fresh distribution of the vague sounds; and upon looking cautiously
 out from cover beheld a motor-car darting across the open space, boun
d outward along Eliot Street, which there intersects both Babson and L
afayette. As I watched‚Äîchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour af
ter a short abatement‚ÄîI saw a band of uncouth, crouching shapes lopi
ng and shambling in the same direction; and knew that this must be the
 party guarding the Ipswich road, since that highway forms an extensio
n of Eliot Street. Two of the figures I glimpsed were in voluminous ro
bes, and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonl
ight. The gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through 
me‚Äîfor it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping. When the las
t of the band was out of sight I resumed my progress; darting around t
he corner into Lafayette Street, and crossing Eliot very hurriedly les
t stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare. 
I did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward Town Squ
are, but accomplished the passage without disaster. My greatest dread 
was in re-crossing broad and moonlit South Street‚Äîwith its seaward v
iew‚Äîand I had to nerve myself for the ordeal. Someone might easily b
e looking, and possible Eliot Street stragglers could not fail to glim
pse me from either of two points. At the last moment I decided I had b
etter slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling
 gait of an average Innsmouth native. When the view of the water again
 opened out‚Äîthis time on my right‚ÄîI was half-determined not to loo
k at it at all. I could not, however, resist; but cast a sidelong glan
ce as I carefully and imitatively shambled toward the protecting shado
ws ahead. There was no ship visible, as I had half expected there woul
d be. Instead, the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat
 pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky, ta
rpaulin-covered object. Its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly 
seen, were of an especially repellent aspect. Several swimmers were st
ill discernible; while on the far black reef I could see a faint, stea
dy glow unlike the winking beacon visible before, and of a curious col
our which I could not precisely identify. Above the slant roofs ahead 
and to the right there loomed the tall cupola of the Gilman House, but
 it was completely dark. The fishy odour, dispelled for a moment by so
me merciful breeze, now closed in again with maddening intensity. I ha
d not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band advancing
 along Washington from the north. As they reached the broad open space
 where I had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water I c
ould see them plainly only a block away‚Äîand was horrified by the bes
tial abnormality of their faces and the dog-like sub-humanness of thei
r crouching gait. One man moved in a positively simian way, with long 
arms frequently touching the ground; while another figure‚Äîrobed and 
tiaraed‚Äîseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion. I judged th
is party to be the one I had seen in the Gilman‚Äôs courtyard‚Äîthe on
e, therefore, most closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned 
to look in my direction I was transfixed with fright, yet managed to p
reserve the casual, shambling gait I had assumed. To this day I do not
 know whether they saw me or not. If they did, my stratagem must have 
deceived them, for they passed on across the moonlit space without var
ying their course‚Äîmeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful g
uttural patois I could not identify. Once more in shadow, I resumed my
 former dog-trot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blan
kly into the night. Having crossed to the western sidewalk I rounded t
he nearest corner into Bates Street, where I kept close to the buildin
gs on the southern side. I passed two houses shewing signs of habitati
on, one of which had faint lights in upper rooms, yet met with no obst
acle. As I turned into Adams Street I felt measurably safer, but recei
ved a shock when a man reeled out of a black doorway directly in front
 of me. He proved, however, too hopelessly drunk to be a menace; so th
at I reached the dismal ruins of the Bank Street warehouses in safety.
 No one was stirring in that dead street beside the river-gorge, and t
he roar of the waterfalls quite drowned my footsteps. It was a long do
g-trot to the ruined station, and the great brick warehouse walls arou
nd me seemed somehow more terrifying than the fronts of private houses
. At last I saw the ancient arcaded station‚Äîor what was left of it‚Ä
îand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end. T
he rails were rusty but mainly intact, and not more than half the ties
 had rotted away. Walking or running on such a surface was very diffic
ult; but I did my best, and on the whole made very fair time. For some
 distance the line kept on along the gorge‚Äôs brink, but at length I 
reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy 
height. The condition of this bridge would determine my next step. If 
humanly possible, I would use it; if not, I would have to risk more st
reet wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge. The vast, b
arn-like length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight,
 and I saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within. Ent
ering, I began to use my flashlight, and was almost knocked down by th
e cloud of bats that flapped past me. About half way across there was 
a perilous gap in the ties which I feared for a moment would halt me; 
but in the end I risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded. 
I was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from that macabre
 tunnel. The old tracks crossed River Street at grade, and at once vee
red off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of Inn
smouth‚Äôs abhorrent fishy odour. Here the dense growth of weeds and b
riers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes, but I was none the less
 glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril. I 
knew that much of my route must be visible from the Rowley road. The m
arshy region began very shortly, with the single track on a low, grass
y embankment where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner. Then came a 
sort of island of higher ground, where the line passed through a shall
ow open cut choked with bushes and brambles. I was very glad of this p
artial shelter, since at this point the Rowley road was uncomfortably 
near according to my window view. At the end of the cut it would cross
 the track and swerve off to a safer distance; but meanwhile I must be
 exceedingly careful. I was by this time thankfully certain that the r
ailway itself was not patrolled. Just before entering the cut I glance
d behind me, but saw no pursuer. The ancient spires and roofs of decay
ing Innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonligh
t, and I thought of how they must have looked in the old days before t
he shadow fell. Then, as my gaze circled inland from the town, somethi
ng less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second.
 What I saw‚Äîor fancied I saw‚Äîwas a disturbing suggestion of undula
nt motion far to the south; a suggestion which made me conclude that a
 very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level Ipsw
ich road. The distance was great, and I could distinguish nothing in d
etail; but I did not at all like the look of that moving column. It un
dulated too much, and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now we
stering moon. There was a suggestion of sound, too, though the wind wa
s blowing the other way‚Äîa suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowi
ng even worse than the muttering of the parties I had lately overheard
. All sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I thought of th
ose very extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centu
ried warrens near the waterfront. I thought, too, of those nameless sw
immers I had seen. Counting the parties so far glimpsed, as well as th
ose presumably covering other roads, the number of my pursuers must be
 strangely large for a town as depopulated as Innsmouth. Whence could 
come the dense personnel of such a column as I now beheld? Did those a
ncient, unplumbed warrens teem with a twisted, uncatalogued, and unsus
pected life? Or had some unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown
 outsiders on that hellish reef? Who were they? Why were they there? A
nd if such a column of them was scouring the Ipswich road, would the p
atrols on the other roads be likewise augmented? I had entered the bru
sh-grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that da
mnable fishy odour again waxed dominant. Had the wind suddenly changed
 eastward, so that it blew in from the sea and over the town? It must 
have, I concluded, since I now began to hear shocking guttural murmurs
 from that hitherto silent direction. There was another sound, too‚Äîa
 kind of wholesale, colossal flopping or pattering which somehow calle
d up images of the most detestable sort. It made me think illogically 
of that unpleasantly undulating column on the far-off Ipswich road. An
d then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I paused shiverin
g and grateful for the cut‚Äôs protection. It was here, I recalled, th
at the Rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing we
stward and diverging. Something was coming along that road, and I must
 lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance. Thank heaven
 these creatures employed no dogs for tracking‚Äîthough perhaps that w
ould have been impossible amidst the omnipresent regional odour. Crouc
hed in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe, even tho
ugh I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me 
not much more than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see them, 
but they could not, except by a malign miracle, see me. All at once I 
began dreading to look at them as they passed. I saw the close moonlit
 space where they would surge by, and had curious thoughts about the i
rredeemable pollution of that space. They would perhaps be the worst o
f all Innsmouth types‚Äîsomething one would not care to remember. The 
stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a bestial babel o
f croaking, baying, and barking without the least suggestion of human 
speech. Were these indeed the voices of my pursuers? Did they have dog
s after all? So far I had seen none of the lower animals in Innsmouth.
 That flopping or pattering was monstrous‚ÄîI could not look upon the 
degenerate creatures responsible for it. I would keep my eyes shut til
l the sounds receded toward the west. The horde was very close now‚Äît
he air foul with their hoarse snarlings, and the ground almost shaking
 with their alien-rhythmed footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to come,
 and I put every ounce of will power into the task of holding my eyeli
ds down. I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a 
hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination. The later action 
of the government, after my frantic appeals, would tend to confirm it 
as a monstrous truth; but could not an hallucination have been repeate
d under the quasi-hypnotic spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowe
d town? Such places have strange properties, and the legacy of insane 
legend might well have acted on more than one human imagination amidst
 those dead, stench-cursed streets and huddles of rotting roofs and cr
umbling steeples. Is it not possible that the germ of an actual contag
ious madness lurks in the depths of that shadow over Innsmouth? Who ca
n be sure of reality after hearing things like the tale of old Zadok A
llen? The government men never found poor Zadok, and have no conjectur
es to make as to what became of him. Where does madness leave off and 
reality begin? Is it possible that even my latest fear is sheer delusi
on? But I must try to tell what I thought I saw that night under the m
ocking yellow moon‚Äîsaw surging and hopping down the Rowley road in p
lain sight in front of me as I crouched among the wild brambles of tha
t desolate railway cut. Of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut h
ad failed. It was foredoomed to failure‚Äîfor who could crouch blindly
 while a legion of croaking, baying entities of unknown source flopped
 noisomely past, scarcely more than a hundred yards away? I thought I 
was prepared for the worst, and I really ought to have been prepared c
onsidering what I had seen before. My other pursuers had been accursed
ly abnormal‚Äîso should I not have been ready to face a strengthening 
of the abnormal element; to look upon forms in which there was no mixt
ure of the normal at all? I did not open my eyes until the raucous cla
mour came loudly from a point obviously straight ahead. Then I knew th
at a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of 
the cut flattened out and the road crossed the track‚Äîand I could no 
longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow m
oon might have to shew. It was the end, for whatever remains to me of 
life on the surface of this earth, of every vestige of mental peace an
d confidence in the integrity of Nature and of the human mind. Nothing
 that I could have imagined‚Äînothing, even, that I could have gathere
d had I credited old Zadok‚Äôs crazy tale in the most literal way‚Äîwo
uld be in any way comparable to the daemoniac, blasphemous reality tha
t I saw‚Äîor believe I saw. I have tried to hint what it was in order 
to postpone the horror of writing it down baldly. Can it be possible t
hat this planet has actually spawned such things; that human eyes have
 truly seen, as objective flesh, what man has hitherto known only in f
ebrile phantasy and tenuous legend? And yet I saw them in a limitless 
stream‚Äîflopping, hopping, croaking, bleating‚Äîsurging inhumanly thr
ough the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fant
astic nightmare. And some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whi
tish-gold metal . . . and some were strangely robed . . . and one, who
 led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped t
rousers, and had a man‚Äôs felt hat perched on the shapeless thing tha
t answered for a head. . . . I think their predominant colour was a gr
eyish-green, though they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and
 slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vague
ly suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish,
 with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the sides of their
 necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed. They h
opped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was 
somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, ba
ying voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark sha
des of expression which their staring faces lacked. But for all of the
ir monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me. I knew too well what 
they must be‚Äîfor was not the memory of that evil tiara at Newburypor
t still fresh? They were the blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless de
sign‚Äîliving and horrible‚Äîand as I saw them I knew also of what tha
t humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomel
y reminded me. Their number was past guessing. It seemed to me that th
ere were limitless swarms of them‚Äîand certainly my momentary glimpse
 could have shewn only the least fraction. In another instant everythi
ng was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting; the first I had ever
 had. V. It was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor i
n the brush-grown railway cut, and when I staggered out to the roadway
 ahead I saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud. The fishy odour,
 too, was gone. Innsmouth‚Äôs ruined roofs and toppling steeples loome
d up greyly toward the southeast, but not a living creature did I spy 
in all the desolate salt marshes around. My watch was still going, and
 told me that the hour was past noon. The reality of what I had been t
hrough was highly uncertain in my mind, but I felt that something hide
ous lay in the background. I must get away from evil-shadowed Innsmout
h‚Äîand accordingly I began to test my cramped, wearied powers of loco
motion. Despite weakness, hunger, horror, and bewilderment I found mys
elf after a long time able to walk; so started slowly along the muddy 
road to Rowley. Before evening I was in the village, getting a meal an
d providing myself with presentable clothes. I caught the night train 
to Arkham, and the next day talked long and earnestly with government 
officials there; a process I later repeated in Boston. With the main r
esult of these colloquies the public is now familiar‚Äîand I wish, for
 normality‚Äôs sake, there were nothing more to tell. Perhaps it is ma
dness that is overtaking me‚Äîyet perhaps a greater horror‚Äîor a grea
ter marvel‚Äîis reaching out. As may well be imagined, I gave up most 
of the foreplanned features of the rest of my tour‚Äîthe scenic, archi
tectural, and antiquarian diversions on which I had counted so heavily
. Nor did I dare look for that piece of strange jewellery said to be i
n the Miskatonic University Museum. I did, however, improve my stay in
 Arkham by collecting some genealogical notes I had long wished to pos
sess; very rough and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use l
ater on when I might have time to collate and codify them. The curator
 of the historical society there‚ÄîMr. E. Lapham Peabody‚Äîwas very co
urteous about assisting me, and expressed unusual interest when I told
 him I was a grandson of Eliza Orne of Arkham, who was born in 1867 an
d had married James Williamson of Ohio at the age of seventeen. It see
med that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on 
a quest much like my own; and that my grandmother‚Äôs family was a top
ic of some local curiosity. There had, Mr. Peabody said, been consider
able discussion about the marriage of her father, Benjamin Orne, just 
after the Civil War; since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly pu
zzling. That bride was understood to have been an orphaned Marsh of Ne
w Hampshire‚Äîa cousin of the Essex County Marshes‚Äîbut her education
 had been in France and she knew very little of her family. A guardian
 had deposited funds in a Boston bank to maintain her and her French g
overness; but that guardian‚Äôs name was unfamiliar to Arkham people, 
and in time he dropped out of sight, so that the governess assumed his
 role by court appointment. The Frenchwoman‚Äînow long dead‚Äîwas very
 taciturn, and there were those who said she could have told more than
 she did. But the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to p
lace the recorded parents of the young woman‚ÄîEnoch and Lydia (Meserv
e) Marsh‚Äîamong the known families of New Hampshire. Possibly, many s
uggested, she was the natural daughter of some Marsh of prominence‚Äîs
he certainly had the true Marsh eyes. Most of the puzzling was done af
ter her early death, which took place at the birth of my grandmother‚Ä
îher only child. Having formed some disagreeable impressions connected
 with the name of Marsh, I did not welcome the news that it belonged o
n my own ancestral tree; nor was I pleased by Mr. Peabody‚Äôs suggesti
on that I had the true Marsh eyes myself. However, I was grateful for 
data which I knew would prove valuable; and took copious notes and lis
ts of book references regarding the well-documented Orne family. I wen
t directly home to Toledo from Boston, and later spent a month at Maum
ee recuperating from my ordeal. In September I entered Oberlin for my 
final year, and from then till the next June was busy with studies and
 other wholesome activities‚Äîreminded of the bygone terror only by oc
casional official visits from government men in connexion with the cam
paign which my pleas and evidence had started. Around the middle of Ju
ly‚Äîjust a year after the Innsmouth experience‚ÄîI spent a week with 
my late mother‚Äôs family in Cleveland; checking some of my new geneal
ogical data with the various notes, traditions, and bits of heirloom m
aterial in existence there, and seeing what kind of connected chart I 
could construct. I did not exactly relish the task, for the atmosphere
 of the Williamson home had always depressed me. There was a strain of
 morbidity there, and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her p
arents as a child, although she always welcomed her father when he cam
e to Toledo. My Arkham-born grandmother had seemed strange and almost 
terrifying to me, and I do not think I grieved when she disappeared. I
 was eight years old then, and it was said that she had wandered off i
n grief after the suicide of my uncle Douglas, her eldest son. He had 
shot himself after a trip to New England‚Äîthe same trip, no doubt, wh
ich had caused him to be recalled at the Arkham Historical Society. Th
is uncle had resembled her, and I had never liked him either. Somethin
g about the staring, unwinking expression of both of them had given me
 a vague, unaccountable uneasiness. My mother and uncle Walter had not
 looked like that. They were like their father, though poor little cou
sin Lawrence‚ÄîWalter‚Äôs son‚Äîhad been an almost perfect duplicate o
f his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclu
sion of a sanitarium at Canton. I had not seen him in four years, but 
my uncle once implied that his state, both mental and physical, was ve
ry bad. This worry had probably been a major cause of his mother‚Äôs d
eath two years before. My grandfather and his widowed son Walter now c
omprised the Cleveland household, but the memory of older times hung t
hickly over it. I still disliked the place, and tried to get my resear
ches done as quickly as possible. Williamson records and traditions we
re supplied in abundance by my grandfather; though for Orne material I
 had to depend on my uncle Walter, who put at my disposal the contents
 of all his files, including notes, letters, cuttings, heirlooms, phot
ographs, and miniatures. It was in going over the letters and pictures
 on the Orne side that I began to acquire a kind of terror of my own a
ncestry. As I have said, my grandmother and uncle Douglas had always d
isturbed me. Now, years after their passing, I gazed at their pictured
 faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienatio
n. I could not at first understand the change, but gradually a horribl
e sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind de
spite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least s
uspicion of it. It was clear that the typical expression of these face
s now suggested something it had not suggested before‚Äîsomething whic
h would bring stark panic if too openly thought of. But the worst shoc
k came when my uncle shewed me the Orne jewellery in a downtown safe-d
eposit vault. Some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough, bu
t there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious
 great-grandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce. The
y were, he said, of very grotesque and almost repulsive design, and ha
d never to his knowledge been publicly worn; though my grandmother use
d to enjoy looking at them. Vague legends of bad luck clustered around
 them, and my great-grandmother‚Äôs French governess had said they oug
ht not to be worn in New England, though it would be quite safe to wea
r them in Europe. As my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap th
e things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent
 hideousness of the designs. Artists and archaeologists who had seen t
hem pronounced the workmanship superlatively and exotically exquisite,
 though no one seemed able to define their exact material or assign th
em to any specific art tradition. There were two armlets, a tiara, and
 a kind of pectoral; the latter having in high relief certain figures 
of almost unbearable extravagance. During this description I had kept 
a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must have betrayed my mountin
g fears. My uncle looked concerned, and paused in his unwrapping to st
udy my countenance. I motioned to him to continue, which he did with r
enewed signs of reluctance. He seemed to expect some demonstration whe
n the first piece‚Äîthe tiara‚Äîbecame visible, but I doubt if he expe
cted quite what actually happened. I did not expect it, either, for I 
thought I was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would
 turn out to be. What I did was to faint silently away, just as I had 
done in that brier-choked railway cut a year before. From that day on 
my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension, nor do I kn
ow how much is hideous truth and how much madness. My great-grandmothe
r had been a Marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in Arkham‚Äîa
nd did not old Zadok say that the daughter of Obed Marsh by a monstrou
s mother was married to an Arkham man through a trick? What was it the
 ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to Captain O
bed‚Äôs? In Arkham, too, the curator had told me I had the true Marsh 
eyes. Was Obed Marsh my own great-great-grandfather? Who‚Äîor what‚Äît
hen, was my great-great-grandmother? But perhaps this was all madness.
 Those whitish-gold ornaments might easily have been bought from some 
Innsmouth sailor by the father of my great-grandmother, whoever he was
. And that look in the staring-eyed faces of my grandmother and self-s
lain uncle might be sheer fancy on my part‚Äîsheer fancy, bolstered up
 by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination. 
But why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in New En
gland? For more than two years I fought off these reflections with par
tial success. My father secured me a place in an insurance office, and
 I buried myself in routine as deeply as possible. In the winter of 19
30‚Äì31, however, the dreams began. They were very sparse and insidiou
s at first, but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went
 by. Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed to wander 
through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy Cyclopean wall
s with grotesque fishes as my companions. Then the other shapes began 
to appear, filling me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But dur
ing the dreams they did not horrify me at all‚ÄîI was one with them; w
earing their unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous ways, and prayi
ng monstrously at their evil sea-bottom temples. There was much more t
han I could remember, but even what I did remember each morning would 
be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever I dared write it
 down. Some frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to drag
 me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of 
blackness and alienage; and the process told heavily on me. My health 
and appearance grew steadily worse, till finally I was forced to give 
up my position and adopt the static, secluded life of an invalid. Some
 odd nervous affliction had me in its grip, and I found myself at time
s almost unable to shut my eyes. It was then that I began to study the
 mirror with mounting alarm. The slow ravages of disease are not pleas
ant to watch, but in my case there was something subtler and more puzz
ling in the background. My father seemed to notice it, too, for he beg
an looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly. What was taking pl
ace in me? Could it be that I was coming to resemble my grandmother an
d uncle Douglas? One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my g
randmother under the sea. She lived in a phosphorescent palace of many
 terraces, with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachi
ate efflorescences, and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been s
ardonic. She had changed‚Äîas those who take to the water change‚Äîand
 told me she had never died. Instead, she had gone to a spot her dead 
son had learned about, and had leaped to a realm whose wonders‚Äîdesti
ned for him as well‚Äîhe had spurned with a smoking pistol. This was t
o be my realm, too‚ÄîI could not escape it. I would never die, but wou
ld live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the eart
h. I met also that which had been her grandmother. For eighty thousand
 years Pth‚Äôthya-l‚Äôyi had lived in Y‚Äôha-nthlei, and thither she h
ad gone back after Obed Marsh was dead. Y‚Äôha-nthlei was not destroye
d when the upper-earth men shot death into the sea. It was hurt, but n
ot destroyed. The Deep Ones could never be destroyed, even though the 
palaeogean magic of the forgotten Old Ones might sometimes check them.
 For the present they would rest; but some day, if they remembered, th
ey would rise again for the tribute Great Cthulhu craved. It would be 
a city greater than Innsmouth next time. They had planned to spread, a
nd had brought up that which would help them, but now they must wait o
nce more. For bringing the upper-earth men‚Äôs death I must do a penan
ce, but that would not be heavy. This was the dream in which I saw a s
hoggoth for the first time, and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of 
screaming. That morning the mirror definitely told me I had acquired t
he Innsmouth look. So far I have not shot myself as my uncle Douglas d
id. I bought an automatic and almost took the step, but certain dreams
 deterred me. The tense extremes of horror are lessening, and I feel q
ueerly drawn toward the unknown sea-deeps instead of fearing them. I h
ear and do strange things in sleep, and awake with a kind of exaltatio
n instead of terror. I do not believe I need to wait for the full chan
ge as most have waited. If I did, my father would probably shut me up 
in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up. Stupendous and un
heard-of splendours await me below, and I shall seek them soon. I√§-R‚
Äôlyeh! Cthulhu fhtagn! I√§! I√§! No, I shall not shoot myself‚ÄîI can
not be made to shoot myself! I shall plan my cousin‚Äôs escape from th
at Canton madhouse, and together we shall go to marvel-shadowed Innsmo
uth. We shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down 
through black abysses to Cyclopean and many-columned Y‚Äôha-nthlei, an
d in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory
 for ever.
